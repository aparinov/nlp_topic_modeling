The church, for example,\nforbids that anyone \"produce, describe or use any substance containing...\natoms\". \n\nPHILIP K. DICK\n\nPhilip K. Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short \nstories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable.\nHe wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than\ntechnology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he\nremained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:\n\n\"Galactic Pot-Healer\"\nA fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a\nremote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When the\ndeity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is\nunable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel.\n\n\"A Maze of Death\"\nNoteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.\n\n\"VALIS\"\nThe schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic\nChristianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of\nunknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic and\ndismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.\n\n\"The Divine Invasion\"\nGod invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from\nanother star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be\nassisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.\n\nMARGARET ATWOOD\n\n\"The Handmaid's Tale\"\nA story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously\nassassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it\n\"right\" again.  The book is the diary of a woman's life as she tries to live\nunder the new Christian theocracy.  Women's right to own property is revoked,\nand their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the\nradio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished\nretroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the \"old world\" are\nhunted down and hanged.  Atwood's writing style is difficult to get used to\nat first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.\n\nVARIOUS AUTHORS\n\n\"The Bible\"\nThis somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.  However, it\nis probably worth reading, if only so that you'll know what all the fuss is\nabout.  It exists in many different versions, so make sure you get the one\ntrue version.\n\n                             Books -- Non-fiction\n\nPETER DE ROSA\n\n\"Vicars of Christ\", Bantam Press, 1988\nAlthough de Rosa seems to be Christian or even Catholic this is a very\nenlighting history of papal immoralities, adulteries, fallacies etc.\n(German translation: \"Gottes erste Diener. Die dunkle Seite des Papsttums\",\nDroemer-Knaur, 1989)\n\nMICHAEL MARTIN\n\n\"Atheism: A Philosophical Justification\", Temple University Press,\n Philadelphia, USA.\nA detailed and scholarly justification of atheism.  Contains an outstanding\nappendix defining terminology and usage in this (necessarily) tendentious\narea.  Argues both for \"negative atheism\" (i.e. the \"non-belief in the\nexistence of god(s)\") and also for \"positive atheism\" (\"the belief in the\nnon-existence of god(s)\").  Includes great refutations of the most\nchallenging arguments for god; particular attention is paid to refuting\ncontempory theists such as Platinga and Swinburne.\n541 pages.

ISBN 0-87722-767-5\n\nJAMES TURNER\n\n\"Without God, Without Creed\", The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore,\n MD, USA\nSubtitled \"The Origins of Unbelief in America\".  Examines the way in which\nunbelief (whether agnostic or atheistic)  became a mainstream alternative\nworld-view.  Focusses on the period 1770-1900, and while considering France\nand Britain the emphasis is on American, and particularly New England\ndevelopments.  \"Neither a religious history of secularization or atheism,\nWithout God, Without Creed is, rather, the intellectual history of the fate\nof a single idea, the belief that God exists.\" \n316 pages. ISBN (hardcover) 0-8018-2494-X (paper) 0-8018-3407-4\n\nGEORGE SELDES (Editor)\n\n\"The great thoughts\", Ballantine Books, New York, USA\nA \"dictionary of quotations\" of a different kind, concentrating on statements\nand writings which, explicitly or implicitly, present the person's philosophy\nand world-view.  Includes obscure (and often suppressed) opinions from many\npeople.  For some popular observations, traces the way in which various\npeople expressed and twisted the idea over the centuries.  Quite a number of\nthe quotations are derived from Cardiff's \"What Great Men Think of Religion\"\nand Noyes' \"Views of Religion\".\n490 pages. ISBN (paper) 0-345-29887-X.\n\nRICHARD SWINBURNE\n\n\"The Existence of God (Revised Edition)\", Clarendon Paperbacks, Oxford\nThis book is the second volume in a trilogy that began with \"The Coherence of\nTheism\" (1977) and was concluded with \"Faith and Reason\" (1981).  In this\nwork, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the\nexistence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely\nupon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and\naesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were\ndecisively rejected in Mackie's \"The Miracle of Theism\".  In the revised\nedition of \"The Existence of God\", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he\nmakes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.\n\nJ. L. MACKIE\n\n\"The Miracle of Theism\", Oxford\nThis (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal\narguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical\nphilosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through\nthe moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements\nof the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those\npositions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational,\nsuch as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as \"replacements for\nGod\" such as Lelie's axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - less\nformalistic and better written than Martin's works, and refreshingly direct\nwhen compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.\n\nJAMES A.

I'm reposting it\njust so Bill doesn't think I'm ignoring him.\n\nIn article <C4w5pv.JxD@darkside.osrhe.uoknor.edu> bil@okcforum.osrhe.edu (Bill Conner) writes:\n>Jim Perry (perry@dsinc.com) wrote:\n>\n>[Some stuff about Biblical morality, though Bill's quote of me had little\n> to do with what he goes on to say]\n\nBill,\n\nI'm sorry to have been busy lately and only just be getting around to\nthis.\n\nApparently you have some fundamental confusions about atheism; I think\nmany of these are well addressed in the famous FAQ.  Your generalisms\nare then misplaced -- atheism needn't imply materialism, or the lack\nof an absolute moral system.  However, I do tend to materialism and\ndon't believe in absolute morality, so I'll answer your questions.\n\n>How then can an atheist judge value? \n\nAn atheist judges value in the same way that a theist does: according\nto a personal understanding of morality.  That I don't believe in an\nabsolute one doesn't mean that I don't have one.  I'm just explicit,\nas in the line of postings you followed up, that when I express\njudgment on a moral issue I am basing my judgment on my own code\nrather than claiming that it is in some absolute sense good or bad.\nMy moral code is not particular different from that of others around\nme, be they Christians, Muslims, or atheists.  So when I say that I\nobject to genocide, I'm not expressing anything particularly out of\nline with what my society holds.\n\nIf your were to ask why I think morality exists and has the form it\ndoes, my answer would be mechanistic to your taste -- that a moral\ncode is a prerequisite for a functioning society, and that humanity\nprobably evolved morality as we know it as part of the evolution of\nour ability to exist in large societies, thereby achieving\nconsiderable survival advantages.  You'd probably say that God just\nmade the rules.  Neither of us can convince the other, but we share a\ncommon understanding about many moral issues.  You think you get it\nfrom your religion, I think I get it (and you get it) from early\nchildhood teaching.\n\n>That you don't like what God told people to do says nothing about God\n>or God's commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your\n>nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled\n>with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. \n\nI think you've been reading the wrong sort of comic books, but in\nprying through the gobbledygook I basically agree with what you're\nsaying.  I do believe that my mental reactions to stimuli such as \"God\ncommanded the genocide of the Canaanites\" is mechanistic, but of\ncourse I think that's true of you as well.  My reaction has little to\ndo with whether God exists or even with whether I think he does, but\nif a god existed who commanded genocide, I could not consider him\ngood, which is supposedly an attribute of God.\n\n>All of this being so, you have excluded\n>yourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil,\n>etc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no\n>weight whatsoever.\n\nHmm.  Yes, I think some heavy FAQ-reading would do you some good.  I\nhave as much place discussing values etc. as any other person.  In\nfact, I can actually accomplish something in such a discussion, by\nframing the questions in terms of reason: for instance, it is clear\nthat in an environment where neighboring tribes periodically attempt\nto wipe each other out based on imagined divine commands, then the\nquality of life will be generally poor, so a system that fosters\ncoexistence is superior, if quality of life is an agreed goal.  An\nabsolutist, on the other hand, can only thump those portions of a\nBible they happen to agree with, and say \"this is good\", even if the\nact in question is unequivocally bad by the standards of everyone in\nthe discussion.  The attempt to define someone or a group of people as\n\"excluded from discussion\", such that they \"cannot participate\", and\ntheir opinions given \"no weight whatsoever\" is the lowest form or\nreasoning (ad hominem/poisoning the well), and presumably the resort\nof someone who can't rationally defend their own ideas of right,\nwrong, and the Bible.\n-- \nJim Perry   perry@dsinc.com   Decision Support, Inc., Matthews NC\nThese are my opinions.

Digital immortality.\n\nThe basic idea behind \"digital immortality\" is that computer networks   \nare here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them\nwill be around near-forever.  The GIFs and JPGs of today will be the\nartifacts of a digital future.  Perhaps they'll be put in different\nformats, perhaps only surviving on backup tapes....but they'll be\nthere...and someone will dig them up.  \n \nIf that doesn't interest you... OTIS also offers a forum for critique\nand exhibition of your works....a virtual art gallery that never closes\nand exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang\nas wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors.  Suddenly, life is \nbreathed into your work...and by merit of it's stimulus, it will \ntravel the globe on pulses of light and electrons.\n \nSpectators are welcome also, feel free to browse the gallery and \nlet the artists know what you think of their efforts.  Keep your own\ncopies of the images to look at when you've got the gumption...\nthat's what they're here for.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWHERE?             \n\nOTIS currently (as of 4/21/93) has two FTP sites.  \n \n \t141.214.4.135 (projects/otis), the UWI site\n\t\t\n\tsunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS), the SUNsite \n\t(you can also GOPHER to this site for OTIS as well)\n\nMerely \"anonymous FTP\" to either site on Internet and change to the\nappropriate directory.  Don't forget to get busy and use the \"bin\"\ncommand to make sure you're in binary.\n\nOTIS has also been spreading to some dial-up BBS systems around North\nAmerica....the following systems have a substancial supply of\nOTIStuff...\n\tUnderground Cafe (Omaha) (402.339.0179) 2 lines\n\tCyberDen (SanFran?) (415.472.5527)  Usenet Waffle-iron\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n \nHOW DO YOU CONTRIBUTE?\n              \nWhat happens is...you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely   \nphoto, get it scanned into an image file, then either FTP-put\nit in the CONTRIB/Incoming directory or use UUENCODE to send it to me\n(email addresses at eof) in email.  After the image is received,\nit will be put into the correct directory.  Computer originated works\nare also welcome.\n\nOTIS' directories house two types of image files, GIF and JPG.  \nGIF and JPG files require, oddly enough, a GIF or JPG viewer to \nsee.  These viewers are available for all types of computers at \nmost large FTP sites around Internet.  JPG viewers are a bit\ntougher to find.  If you can't find one, but do have a GIF viewer,  \nyou can obtain a JPG-to-GIF conversion program which will change    \nJPG files to a standard GIF format. \n\nOTIS also accepts animation files.      \n\nWhen you submit image files, please send me email at the same time\nstating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be\nused (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for people\nto view.  Also, include some biographical information on yourself, we'll\nbe having info-files on each contributing artist and their works.  You \ncan also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of \nemailing).\n\nIf you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope.  Merely send\ncopies to:\n\nThe OTIS Project\nc/o Ed Stastny\nPO BX 241113\nOmaha, NE 68124-1113\n\nI will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will  \nscan them.  Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back.  \nAlso include information on each image, preferably a 1-3 line \ndescription of the image that we can include in the infofile in the\ndirectory where it's finally put.  If you have preferences as to what\nthe images are to be named, include those as well.  \n \nConversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, please\ncontact me and we'll arrange things.\n\nIf you want to submit your works by disk, peachy.  Merely send a 3.5\"\ndisk to the above address (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back.\nThis is good for people who don't have direct access to encoders or FTP,\nbut do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBM\ncompatible format.  If possible, please submit image files as GIF or\nJPG.  If you can't...we can convert from most formats...we'd just rather\nnot have to.\n\nAt senders request, we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they\ncan stand.  Even if you don't have stuff to contribute, you can send\na blank disk and an SASE (or $2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to \nget a slab-o-OTIS.\n\nAs of 04/21/93, we're at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing.  \nEmail me for current archive size and directory.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDISTRIBUTION?\n\nThe images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely   \non the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is\nnot altered in any way (save to convert from one image format to\nanother).  In fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local \nbulletin boards and such.  If you could, please transport the\nappropriate text files along with the images.  \n \nIt would also be nice if you'd send me a note when you did post images\nfrom OTIS to your local bbs.  I just want to keep track of them so\nparticipants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.\n\nIt's the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as\npossible.  If you have the time, please upload a few to your favorite\nBBS system....or even just post this \"info-file\" there.  It would be\nkeen of you.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUSE?\n\nIf you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory,\nyou'll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the \nstipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or\nfull address credit).  You will either find this in the \".rm\" file for    \nthe image or series of images...or in the \"Artists\" directory under the \nArtists name.  If permission isn't explicitly given, then you'll have \nto contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, email\nme (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and I'll get in contact with the artist for \nyou, or give you their contact information.\n \nWhen you DO use permitted work, it's always courteous to let the artist\nknow about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such\ncompensation for their files.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNAMING IMAGES?\n\nPlease keep the names of your files in \"dos\" format.  That means, keep\nthe filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The way\nI usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or\nfour digit \"code\" for the series of images, plus the series number.\nThus, Leonardo DeVinci's fifth mechanical drawing would be something\nlike:\n \n\tldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETC\n\nKeeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will\nremain intact on all systems.  \n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nCREATING IMAGE FILES?\n\nWhen creating image files, be sure to at least include your name\nsomewhere on or below the picture.  This gives people a reference in\ncase they'd like to contact you.  You may also want to include a title,\naddress or other information you'd like people to know.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHMMM?!\n\nThat's about it for now.  More \"guidelines\" will be added as needed.\nYour input is expected.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project has no connection to the Church of OTIS  \n \t     (a sumerian deity) or it's followers, be they pope, priest,\n\t     or ezine administrator.  We do take sacrifices and donations\n\t     however.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project is here for the distribution of original \n \t     image files.  The files will go to the public at large.  \n\t     It's possible, as with any form of mass-media, that someone\n\t     could unscrupulously use your images for financial gain.  \n    \t     Unless you've given permission for that, it's illegal.  OTIS\n\t     takes no responsibility for this.  In simple terms, all rights\n\t     revert to the author/artist.  To leave an image on OTIS is to \n\t     give permission for it to be viewed, copied and distributed \n\t     electronically.  If you don't want your images distributed     \n\t     all-over, don't upload them.  To leave an image on OTIS is\n\t     NOT giving permission to have it used in any publication or\n\t     broadcast that incurs profit (this includes, but is not \n\t     limited to, magazines, newsletters, clip-art software,        \n\t     screen-printed clothing, etc).  You must give specific\n\t     permission for this sort of usage.  \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRemember, the operative term is \"stimulate\".  If you know of people\nthat'd be interested in this sort of thing...get them involved...kick'm\nin the booty....offer them free food...whatever...\n\n....e  (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu)\n       (ed@sunsite.unc.edu)\n\n--\nEd Stastny           | OTIS Project, END PROCESS, SOUND News and Arts \nPO BX 241113\t     | FTP: sunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS)\nOmaha, NE 68124-1113 |      141.214.4.135 (projects/otis)\n---------------------- EMail: ed@cwis.unomaha.edu, ed@sunsite.unc.edu\n"

                    "content": "From: abig@netcom.com (Access Bus Industry Gp)\nSubject: ACCESS.bus (Re: ACCESS.bus Software Creator's Contest)\n\n\tIntro to ACCESS.bus (RE: the ACCESS.bus Software Creator's \n\tContest Announcement)\n\nWHAT IS ACCESS.bus?\n\nACCESS.bus is a new open industry standard for computer \nperipheral connectivity.  ACCESS.bus is a serial protocol that \nuses simple, low-cost I2C technology to link multiple devices to \na single PC port.  Peripheral devices such as keyboards or \nkeypads, locators (Mice, Trackballs, Joysticks), printers, VR \ngloves, digitizers, sensors, actuators or data transmitters and \nothers can be easily daisy chained to the host PC.  Applications \nsuch as CAD/CAM, Data Acquisition, Simulation, Virtual Reality, \nMultiple-Player/Single PC Games, Education and many, many more \ncan now take advantage of ACCESS.bus, the technology that puts \nPlug and Play on every PC.\n\nThe ACCESS.bus offers advantages to end-users and developers of \nsystems and peripherals.  Multiple devices connect to the host \ncomputer with only one port.  Common communication methods for a \nnumber of device types lead to simplified hardware and software \ndevelopment.  As an open standard, ACCESS.bus enables cross-\nplatform use of the same device.\n\nACCESS.bus TECHNOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION:\n=====================================\n\nACCESS.bus technology is an open specification, enabling anyone \nto implement it on host systems or in peripheral devices without \nfee or royalty.\nACCESS.bus has a bus topology architecture.  That is, a single \nhost can accommodate up to 125 peripheral devices.  ACCESS.bus \ndata rate is 100 Kbits/sec.\n\nACCESS.bus Physical Layer\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nACCESS.bus is a serial bus architecture, based on I2C hardware \nprotocol, with one data line and one clock line.\nStandard low-cost I2C microcontrollers handle bit-level \nhandshaking, including automatic arbitration and clock \nsynchronization.  \n\nACCESS.bus Software Protocols\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nThe ACCESS.bus communication protocol is composed of three \nlevels: I2C Protocol, Base Protocol, and Application Protocol.\n\nI2C PROTOCOL: This simple and efficient protocol defines \narbitration among contending masters without losing data.  I2C \nprovides for cooperative synchronization of bus partners with \ndifferent clock rates.  Bus transactions include addressing, \nframing of bits into bytes, and byte acknowledgment by the \nreceiver.  \n\nBASE PROTOCOL: Establishes the asymmetrical interconnect between \na host computer and multiple peripherals.  The host becomes the \nACCESS.bus manager.  The Base Protocol defines the format of an \nACCESS.bus message envelope, which is an I2C bus transaction with \nadditional semantics, including checksum.\nUnique features of the Base Protocol are auto-addressing and hot \nplugging.  Auto-addressing assigns devices with unique bus \naddresses, without the need for setting jumpers or switches.  Hot \nplugging is the ability to attach and detach devices while the \nsystem is running, without rebooting.\n\nAPPLICATION PROTOCOL: This is the highest level of the ACCESS.bus \nprotocol which defines message semantics specific to particular \ntypes of devices.  Each type requires a different Application \nProtocol.  Three broad device types have been identified: \nkeyboards, locators, and text devices.\n\nACCESS.bus support on the PC\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nAll three levels of the ACCESS.bus protocol are supported on the \nPC.  An add-on card implements the physical layer and uses the \nbase protocol to communicate with physical ACCESS.bus devices.  \nAn ACCESS.bus Manager - TSR under DOS and a DLL under Windows 3.1 \n- controls the operation of the physical layer and interacts with \nthe ACCESS.bus device drivers.  Drivers are available for \nmultiple ACCESS.bus keyboards, locators and printers for DOS and \nWindows 3.1.  Also available are C language source code examples \nof the interface from applications to the device drivers.\n\n\nTo Contact ABIG (the ACCESS.bus Industry Group):\n------------------------------------------------\nPostal Address:\n370 Altair Way, Suite 215, Sunnyvale, CA 94086\nInternet Email:  abig@netcom.com\nFax: (408) 991-3773\nVoice: (408) 991-3517\n\n"

Apple cannot patent the concept of a region.\n\nI'm guessing that either NuTek reverse-engineered Apple's internal data\nstructure for regions (I dunno if this would hold up in court), or they\ncame up with their own data structure.  If it's the latter, then they\nwon't be able to draw PICT files containing regions.  Besides PICT files,\nthere aren't many places where regions are stored on disk.  (QuickTime\nmovies, perhaps?)  As long as the region isn't being stored on disk and\ntransferred from a Mac to a NuTek clone (or vice versa), it doesn't\nmatter if NuTek uses a completely different internal data structure.\n\nI remember reading that Apple also has a patent on their ADB hardware,\nand that the NuTek clones would therefore be lacking an ADB port.

The format of the date should be as returned by asctime() \nX\t  using the C locale.  (see guidelines for more info)\nX\nX\t* You may correct/revise a previously submitted entry by sending\nX\t  it to the contest email address.  Be sure to set 'fix' in the \nX\t  ---entry--- section to 'n'.  The corrected entry must use the same \nX\t  title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected.  Be \nX\t  sure that you note the resubmittion in the ---remark--- as well.\nX\nX\t* With the exception of the header, all text outside of the above \nX\t  format may be ignored by the judges.  If you need tell the judges\nX\t  something, put it in the ---remark--- section, or send a separate\nX\t  Email message to the judges.\nX\nX\t* Information from the ---author--- section will be published unless \nX\t  'y' was given to the respective author's 'anon' line.\nX\nX\t* To credit multiple authors, include an ---author--- section for\nX\t  each author.  Each should start with ---author--- line, and\nX\t  should be found between the ---entry--- and ---build--- sections.\nX\nX\t* The entry's remarks should include:\nX\t    - what this program does\nX\t    - how to run the program (sample args or input)\nX\t    - special compile or execution instructions, if any\nX\t    - special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5)\nX\t    - information about any ---data--- files\nX\t    - why you think the program is obfuscated\nX\t    - note if this entry is a re-submission of a previous entry.\nX\t    - any other remarks (humorous or otherwise)\nX\nX\t* Do not rot13 your entry's remarks.  You may suggest that certain\nX\t  portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award.\nX\nX        * Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  They \nX\t  should not be required to exist.\nX\nX\t  If your entry does not need an info file, skip the ---info---\nX\t  section.  If your entry needs multiple info files, use multiple \nX\t  ---info--- sections, one per info file.  You should describe\nX\t  each info file in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    4) If your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows:\nX\nX\t   'build' is incorporated into a makefile, and 'build' is removed\nX\t   'prog.c' is renamed to your entry's title, followed by an optional\nX\t       digit, followed by '.c'\nX\t   your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry's\nX\t       title, possibly followed by a digit\nX\nX       If your entry requires that a build file exist, state so in your\nX       entry's remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to execute a\nX       build shell script containing the 'build' information.  The name of\nX       this build shell script will be your entry's title, possibly followed\nX       by a digit, followed by '.sh'.\nX\nX       If needed, your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry must\nX       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames.\nX\nX    5) The build file, the source and the resulting executable should be\nX       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files,\nX       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If this\nX       occurs, state so in your entry's remarks.\nX\nX    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected.\nX       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted, as long as it does not \nX       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers.\nX\nX    7) The program must be of original work.  All programs must be in the\nX       public domain.  All copyrighted programs will be rejected.\nX\nX    8) Entries must be received prior to 07-May-93 0:00 UTC.

The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions.\nX    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are\nX    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines.\nX\nX    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries.\nX    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines.\nX\nX\nXWHAT IS NEW IN 1993:\nX\nX    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c\nX    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT.\nX\nX    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C\nX    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers \nX    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with \nX    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor \nX    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES.\nX\nX\nXHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS:\nX\nX    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See\nX    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners.\nX\nX    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries\nX    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year\nX    might be 'old' the next year.\nX\nX    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply\nX    a number of tests to an entry:\nX\nX\t* look at the original source\nX\t* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII\nX\t* C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines\nX\t* C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines\nX\t* run it through a C beautifier\nX\t* examine the algorithm\nX\t* lint it\nX\t* compile it\nX\t* execute it\nX\nX    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests.\nX    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been\nX    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier.\nX\nX    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain\nX    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the\nX    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as\nX    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given\nX    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that\nX    does something interesting when you run it.\nX\nX    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave\nX    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life\nX    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request\nX    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the\nX    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way.\nX\nX    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know\nX    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse\nX    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the\nX    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to\nX    annoy more than amuse.\nX\nX    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries\nX    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules'\nX    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use\nX    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-)\nX\nX    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make\nX    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly\nX    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some\nX    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work.\nX\nX    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that\nX    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off\nX    documenting it.  Noting \"this entry sometimes prints the 4th power\nX    of a prime by mistake\" would save the above entry.  And sometimes,\nX    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly\nX    working entry is best.\nX\nX\nXOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES:\nX\nX    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We\nX    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests\nX    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as far\nX    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion.\nX\nX    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we:\nX\nX\t#define d define\nX\t#d foo\t\t   <-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo\nX\nX\tint i;\nX\tj;\t\t   <-- don't use such implicit type declaration\nX\tint k;\nX\nX    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you \nX    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in \nX    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers.\nX\nX    Unfortunately, ANSI C requires array indexes to be of integral type.\nX    Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed:\nX\nX\tint i;\nX\tchar *c;\nX\ti[c];\t\t   <--- use c[i] instead\nX\t(i+3)[\"string\"];   <--- use \"string\"[i+3] instead\nX\nX    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of\nX    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety\nX    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are\nX    not portable and must not be used:\nX\nX\t* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable\nX\t* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable\nX\t* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg\nX\t* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg\nX\t* performing arithmetic on va_list variables\nX\t* using va_list as a structure or union\nX\nX    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s.\nX\nX    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead.\nX\nX    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...),\nX    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While some\nX    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not.\nX\nX    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries\nX    must not assume that it returns an int.\nX\nX    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise.\nX    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do\nX    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people\nX    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for\nX    programs that are compact, and are instructional.\nX\nX    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80\nX    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion.\nX\nX    We tend to dislike programs that:\nX\nX\t* are very hardware specific\nX\t* are very OS or Un*x version specific\nX\t     (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific\nX\t      code is likely not to be)\nX\t* dump core or have compiler warnings\nX\t     (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item)\nX\t* won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x\nX\t* abusing the build file to get around the size limit\nX\t* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs\nX\t* are longer than they need to be\nX\t* are similar to previous winners\nX\t* are identical to previous losers  :-)\nX\nX    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the\nX    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program\nX    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines.\nX\nX    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size\nX    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out,\nX    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order to\nX    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel\nX    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off\nX    if you show some amount of restraint.\nX\nX    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact\nX    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get\nX    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters.\nX\nX    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob\nX    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C\nX    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third\nX    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting\nX    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two!\nX\nX    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating'\nX    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim\nX    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating\nX    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating.\nX    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others)\nX    know of a smaller one!\nX\nX    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that\nX    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't\nX    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't depend\nX    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store.\nX\nX    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and\nX    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client\nX    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the\nX    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a).\nX    Don't use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone\nX    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not\nX    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or\nX    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better\nX    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems.\nX\nX    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on\nX    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines\nX    in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    We like programs that:\nX\nX\t* are as concise and small as they need to be\nX\t* do something at least quasi-interesting\nX\t* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice)\nX\t* are portable\nX\t* are unique or novel in their obfuscation style\nX\t* MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION\nX\t* make us laugh and/or throw up  :-)\nX\nX    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course, your\nX    program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several\nX    areas really does help.\nX\nX    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in\nX    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to\nX    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two.\nX    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well.\nX\nX    Be creative!\nX\nX\nXENTRY FORMAT:\nX\nX    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your\nX    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format,\nX    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the\nX    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS)\nX\nX    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to\nX    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that\nX    is found in mkentry.c:\nX\nX\tThis program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every\nX\tattempt has been made to make sure that this program produces\nX\tan entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases,\nX\twhere this program differs from the contest rules, the\nX\tcontest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the\nX\tcontest rules before submitting an entry.\nX\nX    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however,\nX    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check\nX    the entry against the size rules.\nX\nX    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about\nX    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.

You \nX\t  should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections.\nX\nX    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files,\nX    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid\nX    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should\nX    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This\nX    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch.\nX\nX    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We\nX    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the\nX    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them\nX    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files,\nX    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed,\nX    then skip the ---info--- section.\nX\nX    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that\nX    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an\nX    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample\nX    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a\nX    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a\nX    'hints' file.\nX\nX    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For\nX    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed\nX    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental,\nX    the entry should not require them exist.\nX\nX    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name\nX    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason,\nX    say so in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they\nX    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say\nX    so in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has\nX    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should\nX    have entry number 0.\nX\nX    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry\nX    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place text outside of the\nX    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't\nX    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the \nX    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at:\nX\nX\t...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges\t(not the address for\nX\tjudges@toad.com\t\t\t\t\t submitting entries)\nX    \nX    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer \nX    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as \nX    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is:\nX\nX\tThr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993\nX\nX    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The\nX    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many \nX    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string:\nX\nX\tdate -u \"+%a %h %d %T 19%y\"\nX\tdate -u | sed -e 's/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/'\nX\tsh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e \"s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/\"'\nX\tsh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e \"s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/\"'\nX\tsh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e \"s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/\"'\nX\nX    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, set\nX    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'.\nX    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number\nX    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be\nX    replaced.\nX\nX\nXJUDGING PROCESS:\nX\nX    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll.\nX\nX    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message\nX    is unpacked into individual files, each containing:\nX\nX\t---entry--- section\nX\tall ---author--- sections\nX\tall ---info--- sections\nX\t---build--- section\nX\t---program--- section\nX\tany other text, including the Email message headers\nX\nX    Prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure\nX    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was\nX    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the\nX    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is\nX    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award.\nX\nX    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular\nX    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are\nX    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding\nX    out in the end, who won and where they were from.\nX\nX    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award.\nX    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make all\nX    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning\nX    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even\nX    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious,\nX    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC\nX    winners at talks)\nX\nX    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the\nX    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give\nX    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their\nX    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We\nX    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well.\nX    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world.\nX\nX    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round,\nX    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles;\nX    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does\nX    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the\nX    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings.\nX\nX    A reading consists of a number of actions:\nX\nX\t* reading the ---entry--- section\nX\t* reading the uudecoded ---build--- section\nX\t* reading the uudecoded ---program--- section\nX\t* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any\nX\t* passing the source thru the C pre-processor\nX\t    shipping over any #include files\nX\t* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source\nX\t* passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor\nX\t    shipping over any #include files\nX\nX    In later rounds, other actions are performed:\nX\nX\t* linting the source\nX\t* compiling/building the source\nX\t* running the program\nX\t* performing misc tests on the source and binary\nX\nX    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries\nX    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it\nX    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round.\nX    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form\nX    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards.\nX    An entry often will compete in several categories.\nX\nX    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries\nX    we receive.  A typical category list might be:\nX\nX\t* best small one line program\nX\t* best small program\nX\t* strangest/most creative source layout\nX\t* most useful obfuscated program\nX\t* best game that is obfuscated\nX\t* most creatively obfuscated program\nX\t* most deceptive C code\nX\t* best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES)\nX\t* best abuse of ANSI C\nX\t* worst abuse of the rules\nX\t* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award>\nX\nX    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so\nX    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round.\nX    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary.\nX\nX    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of\nX    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10\nX    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into\nX    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not\nX    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is\nX    less clear cut.\nX\nX    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out\nX    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is\nX    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry \nX    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course, \nX    that the entry is worth improving in the first place!\nX\nX    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a\nX    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest\nX    rules in some way.\nX\nX    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such\nX    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the\nX    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories.\nX\nX\nXANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS:\nX\nX    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition,\nX    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to\nX    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF.\nX\nX    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups:\nX\nX\t    comp.lang.c\t\t  comp.unix.wizards\talt.sources\nX\nX    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following\nX\nX\t    comp.sources.d\t  alt.sources.d\t\tmisc.misc\nX\t    comp.sources.misc\t  comp.windows.x\nX\nX    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.  See\nX    below for details.\nX\nX    Often, winning entries are published in selected magazines.  Winners \nX    have appeared in books (\"The New Hackers Dictionary\") and on T-Shirts.\nX\nX    Last, but not least, winners receive international fame and flames!  :-)\nX\nX\nXFOR MORE INFORMATION:\nX\nX    You may contact the judges by sending Email to the following address:\nX\nX\t...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges\t(not the address for\nX\tjudges@toad.com\t\t\t\t\t submitting entries)\nX\nX    Questions and comments about the contest are welcome.\nX\nX    One may obtain a copy of the current rules, guidelines or mkentry\nX    program.

Investigation showed that some X\nservers will happily return any size up to the size of the root window, while\nothers return some fixed limit of more reasonable size. The interesting thing\nto me is that the same server binary acts differently on different hardware -\na Sun4 with a cg2 will claim cursors up to root window size are OK, while a\nSun4 with a cg6 will stop at 32x32. So far I've also seen this behavior on\nNCD and Phase-X X terminals and have been told it also occurs on HPs. \nActually, the NCD is even more liberal - sizes much larger then the root\nwinodw are gladly returned as OK.

I've put together a list and\nindicated what I think each item is worth.  This is just my estimate, and I\nam very open to any offers, including trades.  I'm currently looking for\nsome CD-ROMs that will work with a Mac CD ROM player CD Caddies, HD floppy \ndisks, any used Macintosh software, a 387-33Mhz Co-Processor, or basically \nanything you have lying around (cans of soup, the neighbor's cat, etc...)  \nMake me an offer, no offer will be overlooked... \nI really want to get rid of this stuff...\n\nOk, Here's the list:\n\n52 Meg 3.5\" SCSI Hard Drive.  Conner Model #CP-3150.  I bought this from a guy\n\tat a swap meet to use with my Macintosh.  Unfortunately, I can't seem \n\tto get it to work with the SCSI controller in my computer.  The\n\tguy tested it with his PC, and printed out a copy of the Norton Disk \n\tDoctor report which says it has no bad sectors. (I'll send you a copy) \n\tI was dumb enough not to get his phone number, so I can't return it to \n\thim. The drive has many jumpers on it, (which I don't know how to set) \n\tso maybe that's the problem.  I was quite disappointed that it didn't\n\twork so I'm trying to minimize my losses.\t~$45\n\n52 Meg 3.5\" SCSI Hard Drive. Conner Model #CP-3150.  Same situation as above.\n\tI bought both of these drives from the same guy.  Despite the different\n\tmodel numbers they are the same exact drive.  Same report from NDD\n\t(I have one for each drive) will be included.\t~$45\n\n40 Meg SONY 3.5\" SCSI Hard Drive.  SONY Model #SRD2040A.  The drive mechanism \n\tis completely trashed.  This hard drive was in my computer (Mac SE) and\n\thad a stiction problem.  Well, repeated banging on the side of the\n\tcomputer resulted in a head crash (yes, metal scraping metal) which\n\twas not too pleasant to listen to.  Still the SCSI controller\n\tcard is in good working order, and can be used for parts, or a \n\tproject.\t~$20\n\n65 Meg Seagate 5.25\" HH SCSI Hard Drive.  Model #ST-277N.  I originally bought\n\tthis drive, because it had a small stiction problem, and I though that\n\tI could fix it.  Well I determined that the drive mechanism was fine,\n\tand that it was a controller problem.  (motor controller wasn't sending\n\tproper signals.)  Well, after taking the controller off the drive, \n\tlooking at it, and putting it back together, I realized that I\n\taccidentally severed one of the small flat cables that connect the \n\tdrive to the controller.  I tried to solder it, but I'm not that good\n\tat soldering so I couldn't do it.  Worked perfectly before I messed\n\tup.  I used it as a temporary drive when the SONY (above) crashed on\n\tme.  Also loaded the drive with about twenty Mac applications,\n\tworth well over $1000.  (Claris CAD, MS Word 5.0, Think C,\n\tExcel, and many others) \n\tI think all it needs is a resoldering of that cable.  You also get all\n\tthe software on the drive. (if you can accept being a pirate)  I only \n\task that you delete my data files from the drive.  I was really angry\n\twhen I broke that connection, and then couldn't fix it.  I just don't \n\thave time to play with it any more.\t~$65\n\nAT&T ISDN 7500 Modem.  This is for use on digital phone systems.  If you know\n\twhat this is or would like technical information on it, let me know.  I\n\thave some tech documents on it.  Is supposed to be the same thing as an\n\tAT&T digital phone, but without the phone part.  It seems to be in  \n\tworking order (passes self test perfectly OK).  I have no idea how \n\tthis is worth...   Let me know if you're interested.\n\nMotorola 68881 CoProcessor.  I haven't tested this one out yet, but if anyone \n\tis interested I will get it tested out, to make sure that it works.  I\n\thad trouble using it with my accelerator board, but then I spoke to the\n\tmanufacturer of the board and found out it couldn't be used without \n\tanother controller chip.  When I was looking around to buy one new, the\n\tprices were around $100.  I will guarantee this to work.\t~$65\n\nCGA Card.  Half-Length. 8-bit.  Wasn't working last time I checked (although\n\tI think I was using a bad monitor)\t~$5\n\n5.25\"\t360K Floppy Drive.  IBM Drive Type 1355.  Guaranteed to work, \n\tbecause when I took it out of the PC, it was working!\t\t~$25\n\n5.25\" 360K Floppy Drive.  Toshiba Model Number ND-08DE-A.  Guaranteed to \n\twork.  Came out of same PC as above.\t~$25\n\n5.25\"\tFloppy Drives.  Can't guarantee that these will work.  I don't\n\teven know if they are low or high density drives.  I don't have\n\tany method of testing them.\n\t\tPanasonic Model number: JU-455-5 ACG.  There's another\n\t\t\tnumber on it: 2626-361723.\n\t\tPanasonic Model number: JU-475-2 AGG.  There's also\n\t\t\tanother number on it: H3649-101457\n\t\tToshiba Model Number ND-08DE.  Virtually identical to the one \n\t\t\tabove.\n\tEach Drive ~$10\n\n3.5\" PS/2 Drive.  These things are proprietary, so I can't test it, but I\n\tthink it works.  Not sure if it's high density or low density, but I\n\tsuppose someone who is looking for one would know.  Model Number\n\tDFL413C04A.  I think these things are expensive to replace.  ~$35\n\nMFM Hard Drive Controller Cards.  I've got three of these, and I have no way\n\tof testing them.  Two of them are 8-bit cards, and one is a sixteen bit\n\tcard with a floppy controller built in.\t~$10 for the 8-bits ~$15 for\n\tthe 16-bit card w/floppy.\n\nInteresting cable.  Seems to convert from a VGA plug to an EGA plug.  That is,\n\tstandard nine-pin to VGA 15 pin. Made by Hewlett Packard.  Part No.\n\tD1181-80020\t\t~$10\n\n\n\nI've sold stuff like this before, and it was a huge success, with many \nsatisfied people trading or bartering stuff they didn't need anymore.  I \nusually ship through the U.S. Postal Service (haven't had any problems yet) \nand the shipping costs will be split or negotiated.\n\nWell, that's all folks.  As I said before, no offer will be refused.  If you \ncan convince me to give OCit to you instead of throwing it out, TRY!  I hate\nto throw away stuff...\n\n\n-Wayne\n\nwdempsey@athena.mit.edu\n(617)-225-9349\n\n\n\n"

My car has 11,500\nmiles on it and is a '92 model.  The NX2000 the dealer is selling is a '91\nmodel with 23,000miles on it.  It has a T-Bar Roof, a/c, and an airbag,\nwhich my Sentra does not have.  They are asking for $1500.  Is that a fair\ndeal?  The only thing I noticed about the NX2000 is that the engine did not\nseem to have as much torque as my Sentra which has the same identical\nengine.  I presume that the last lady owner did not really push the engine\nto it's limits occassionaly while I did that on mine, thuis the NX2000's\nengine is a little \"tight.\"  So, if I buy the NX2000 and \"excercise\" it\nwell, should that slight power problem go away?

Basically, limited tort means that you give up your right to sue\nfor pain and suffering, unless one of the following conditions is met:\n1. Your medical bills resulting from the accident exceed $X (where X is\nsome number like 50,000 -- I'm not sure of the exact number)\n\n2. The accident was caused by a drunk driver (I mean, the OTHER driver\nwas drunk)\n\n3. You get a good lawyer and have a good case (basically, you can appeal\nto regain your right to sue, but there's almost no chance of this ever\nhappening).\n\nYou are only giving up your right to sue for pain and suffering; you can\nstill sue for medical costs, actual damages, etc. By agreeing to limited\ntort, you are essentially giving up your right to be an asshole who\ntreats every accident as an entry into the litigation lottery.

I just installed a set of Bosch air horns ordered from \nDennis Kirk (pg. 282 of the latest catalog) on my '85 FJ1100. They are rated\nat 93db at 7 meters. I installed them using 10 gage wire from the battery to\nthe relay to the compressor to ground. My stock horn connectors fit the relay\npins just fine. I soldered the connections to the relay and compressor, and used\na crimp type battery connector and an inline 10amp fuse/connector from NAPA.\n\tI installed the compressor just forward of the fuse box in the front\nfairing by tie wrapping between the steering head frame and the black steel tube\nframe used to support the front fairing. You have to remove the front fairing to\ndo this, but it fits outside of the frame but inside the fairing on the two\nvertical supports just in front of the fuses. Depending how tight your fairing\nfollows the frame, you should be able to fit it somewhere in the fairing.\nThe compressor is about 2\" in diameter and about 5\" long.\n\tThe relay mounted on the front of the steering head frame (it is small\nso there should be plenty of good places for it.\n\tI found a perfect place for the horns that required only tie wraps to\nmount. The horns fit inside the front fairing/frame and stick out on either side\njust in front of the air scoops, but behind the turn signals. The back of the\nhorns point back towards the center of the bike and come real close to where\nthe gas tank connects to the front part of the frame. There is just enough\nroom to the outside to allow full lock to lock clearance, and there are nice\ncut outs in the frame for the back of the horn to go into.\n\tThe short horn is even with the fairing, and the long one sticks out\nabout an inch or so, but it is really not that noticable unless you look\nclosely. They end up pointing down slightly and maybe 30 degrees from straight\nahead (perfect for those cagers trying to change lanes into you).\n\tIf you have any other questions about the mounting, email, and I can try\nto explain better. If your bike is not red, then you may want to paint them\nfirst.\n\tHow do they work you ask? They are very, very, very *LOUD*. They sound\nmore like a european sports car than a truck, but a vast improvement over stock.\nI have used them at least daily since installing them, and the 10 amp fuse has\nnot blown yet (although, the duration of the horn blasts have been short).\n\tI've repeatedly scared the shit out of my friends with them, even though\nthey know that I have the horns, they still jump. They are perfect for keeping\nthe pedestrians on the sidewalk.\nThe bottom line is they work, are loud enough to cause pain and suffering to\nthose stupid lane changing cages (as well as take a few years off their lives)\nand are relatively easy to install on the FJ.

My top is a 46L and the bottom is a 48L.  For the\nbottom, the waist is far too large, but the thighs fit just right (the\n46 had a better waist, but cut off the circulation in my legs, I have\nlarge, muscular thighs, and no, I didn't use the thighmaster to get\nthem :-).  The jacket fits me ok in the chest, slightly snug at the\nwaist, and too small in the arms.  I can't imagine finding a one-piece\nsize that would have fit correctly, as even the 2 piece has it's\nproblems (strange, since my V-Pilot jacket fits great all over, and\nwhen I tried the matching pants, they fit like a glove as well).\n\nI can only assume the models Aero Design uses to design its suits are\nin some way different from us real folks.\n\nAlso, even though it's related to convienience, you look pretty damn\nwierd walking around with the tops and bottoms while running errands.\nI've gotten some really suspicious looks, and sweated a lot while in a\nstore wearing the whole suit, since you can't fit the top and bottom\nin any motorcycle storage device yet devised (except the trunk in my\nsidecar rig :-).  With the two piece, I unzip the pants (I generally\nleave the two pieces zipped together, primarily because the pants fall\ndown unless I pull the cheesy elastic belt-type band real tight),\nstuff them in one of my spacious BMW saddlebags (the pants just fit),\nand run errands just wearing the jacket.  Actually, if I know I'll be\nrunning errands, I just wear my V-Pilot jacket, but that's just me...\n\nAs far as crash protection, I'd say that both suits are probably\nequal.  It seems that for weather protection, if anything the 2 piece\nprovides a little more because of the jacket overlapping the pants by\n3 inches.  The 2 piece is probably a little less comfortable around\nthe waist, just because of the extra layer of stuff, but maybe not.\n\nSo I'd have to vote for the two piece.  Despite the slightly odd fit,\nI still find the suit the most versatile piece of riding clothing I\nown.  Wouldn't go long distance without it.\n\nKen Wallich <wallich@ncd.com> \nken@wallich.com ~ kmw@al.org ~ [...]decwrl!vixie!amber!ken\n--\nKen Wallich <wallich@ncd.com> \nken@wallich.com ~ kmw@al.org ~ [...]decwrl!vixie!amber!ken\n"

But my point is that\nit wasn't Mario himself, but it was the *expectation* of things to come (i.e.\na winning team) that he created by being the next great hockey superstar. And\nbefore anybody jumps in and says I'm nit-picking and mincing words, go back\nand read from where this thread started...\n\nIt might help to think about what would go through a fan's mind who suddenly\nfound an interest in Mario and the Pens.  Was it \"gee, Mario Lemieux is\namazing, I'll go watch him play\", or was it \"gee, now we've got a *kick*\n*ass* guy on *our* side, I'll go watch him play\".  I think it was the latter.\n\n> Similar thing happened in L.A.   Before\n>Gretzky's arrival, about 12000 per game.  After, constant sellouts.

The *tickets* sell, but people don't go to\nthe games.  I think this thread has already been discussed...season ticket\nholders in LA don't always use their tickets.  So in effect, after the Kings\ninitial success following Gretzky's arrival (68 to 91 points, same source)\nand corresponding attendance jump, there has been an effective drop in\nattendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much.  \n\nWhether or not the Kings are a 'winner' is debatable.  I claim that since\nGretzky's arrival they have at the very least been competitive...I also claim\nthat McNall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the Oiler\ndynasty...but that's another story and included only because I don't like\nMcNall:-).  Anyway,  McNall did do some heavy marketing around Gretzky, and\nthat undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising\nsales, etc.  But as I said, when the Kings have been in there little\ntailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at the\nForum even if the tickets were sold.\n\n>I think in the case of a Lemieux or Gretzky, the player can transcend\n>winning as the major drawing power.  \n\nFor the short term, IMO.

This is due to the emergence of Teemu Selanne.\n>They have the 17th best record in hockey, it sure as hell isn't because\n>they are winning.\n\nYes, but they are doing no worse than last year.  I think the same type of\nreasoning I applied to a new Pittsburgh fan applies to all the extra people\nshowing up at Winnipeg games.  It's difficult to predict, but do you think\nthat if the Jets miss the playoffs next season that in the year after they\nwill maintain their attendance levels?  I seriously doubt it, because in that\ncase the expectation of an improving team would be gone, with or without\nSelanne.\n\nI did provide the example of Rocket Ismail and the Toronto Argonauts of the \nCFL...did you leave it out because you don't know much about the CFL?  If \nthat's the case then fair enough, but if it isn't the case then I'm curious\nto hear your explanation.\n\n\n"

The ruling in\nCohen et al. v. Brown University is the first appeals court decision\nin the nation applying Title IX to intercollegiate athletics.  Trial\nLawyers for Public Justice (TLPJ), is the national public interest\nlaw firm representing the women athletes.\n   \"This ruling makes clear what we have said all along -- if a\nschool wants to eliminate teams before women have their fair share of\nopportunities to participate, they can only eliminiate men's teams,\"\nsaid TLPJ Executive Director Arthur Bryant, co-counsel in the case.\n   The class action, filed April, 1992, charged Brown with violating\nTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the federal law that\nprohibits sex discrimination by all educational institutions\nreceiving federal funds.  Brown terminated the two women's teams as\nuniversity-funded sports in May 1991, allowing them to continue to\ncompete against varsity teams if they could raise their own funds for\nuniforms, travel, coaches, and all other expenses.  They had also\nbeen denied admission preferences for use in recruiting new members.\n   \"This is a major victory for women and the cause of equal rights,\"\nsaid TLPJ lead counsel Lynette Labinger of Providence's Roney &\nLabinger.  \"Universities across America need to reevaluate their\nprograms quickly. Title IX is the law and it's going to be enforced.\"\n   Three similar Title IX appeals await decision.  Colorado State\nUniversity, Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP), and Colgate\nUniversity are asking federal appeals courts to overturn court orders\nrequiring them to reinstate or establish specific women's varsity\nteams.  Continuing its cutting-edge Title IX activities, TLPJ is\nrepresenting women athletes at IUP.\n   In addition to Labinger and Bryant, TLPJ's legal team included:\nRay Marcaccio of Blish & Cavanagh and Amato DeLuca of Mandell, DeLuca\n& Schwartz in Providence; and Sandra Duggan of Philadelphia.

It\n(this FAQ, not RIPEM) was written and will be maintained by Marc\nVanHeyningen, <mvanheyn@whale.cs.indiana.edu>.  It will be posted to a\nvariety of newsgroups on a monthly basis; follow-up discussion specific\nto RIPEM is redirected to the group alt.security.ripem.\n\nThis month, I have reformatted this posting in an attempt to comply\nwith the standards for HyperText FAQ formatting to allow easy\nmanipulation of this document over the World Wide Web.  Let me know\nwhat you think.\n\nDISCLAIMER\n----------\nNothing in this FAQ should be considered legal advice, or anything\nother than one person's opinion.  If you want real legal advice, talk\nto a real lawyer.\n\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\n---------------------\n\n1)  What is RIPEM?\n\n RIPEM is a program which performs Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) using\n the cryptographic techniques of RSA and DES.  It allows your\n electronic mail to have the properties of authentication (i.e. who\n sent it can be confirmed) and privacy (i.e. nobody can read it except\n the intended recipient.)\n\n RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>.\n Most of the code is in the public domain, except for the RSA routines,\n which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.\n\n2)  How can I get RIPEM?\n\n RIPEM contains the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF, which is\n considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution\n to people who are not citizens or permanent residents of the U.S. or\n Canada.  Therefore, the following request is quoted from the README\n file:\n\n #Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution\n #outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me,\n #the author of RIPEM, and a condition of your use of RIPEM.\n\n Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain, and a license for it is\n included with the distribution.  You should read it before using\n RIPEM.\n\n The best way to get it is to ask a friend for a copy, since this will\n reduce the load on those sites that do carry it (not to mention the\n humans that run them.)  Naturally this requires that you trust the\n friend.\n\n RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent residents\n in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the README file for\n info.  Last I looked, this site contains only the source tree, and\n does not contain compiled binaries or the nice Mac version.\n\n RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its \"home site\" on\n rpub.cl.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the\n U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out\n how to obtain access, ftp there, cd to pub/crypt/, and read the file\n GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience, binaries for many architectures are\n available here in addition to the full source tree.\n\n3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine?\n\n Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of\n Unix (SunOS, NeXT, Linux, AIX, ULTRIX, Solaris, etc.)  Ports to\n Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice\n Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau, author of StuffIt.  More ports\n are expected, and help of users is invited.\n\n4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer?\n\n Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend\n on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though.  The users\n guide, included with the distribution, discusses ways to use RIPEM\n with many popular mailers, including Berkeley, mush, Elm, and MH.\n Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU\n Emacs.\n\n If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one\n in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use, secure,\n and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem.\n\n5)  What is RSA?\n\n RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key.  This means\n that there are two different, related keys: one to encrypt and one to\n decrypt.  Because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other,\n you may publish your encryption, or public key widely and keep your\n decryption, or private key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public\n key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to\n decrypt it.  (Note that the \"message\" sent with RSA is normally just\n the DES key to the real message. (See \"What is DES?\")\n\n Note that the above only provides for privacy.  For authentication,\n the fingerprint of the message (See \"What is a fingerprint, like\n MD5?\") is encrypted with the sender's private key.  The recipient can\n use the sender's public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message\n must have come from the sender.\n\n RSA was named for the three men (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) who\n invented it.  To find out more about RSA, ftp to rsa.com and look in\n pub/faq/ or look in sci.crypt.\n\n6)  What is DES?\n\n DES is the Data Encryption Standard, a widely used symmetric, or\n secret-key, crypto system.  Unlike RSA, DES uses the same key to\n encrypt and decrypt messages.  However, DES is much faster than RSA.\n\n RIPEM uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts\n your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the\n recipient's public RSA key and includes the result in the letter,\n allowing the recipient to recover the DES key.\n\n DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a\n key length considered too short by modern standards.  However, it\n should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large\n corporation or government agency.  It is not unlikely that future\n RIPEMs will strengthen the symmetric cipher, possibly by using\n multiple encryption with DES.\n\n7)  What is PEM, and how does RIPEM relate?\n\n PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail, a system for allowing easy transfer of\n encrypted electronic mail.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; these\n documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115.\n\n RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM, because PEM\n specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which RIPEM does not\n handle at this time.  Their addition is planned.\n\n8)  What's this about distributing and authenticating keys?\n\n For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know\n your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message\n received came from her, you must know her public key.  It is important\n that this information be accurate; if a \"bad guy\" convinces her that\n his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read.\n\n RIPEM allows for three methods of key management: a central server,\n the distributed finger servers, and a flat file.  All three are\n described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution.\n None of them provide perfect security.\n\n9)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar?\n\n RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS identifier describing various\n characteristics about the key, so the first bunch of characters in\n your key may be the same as those of lots of other people's keys.\n This does not mean your keys are similar, but only that they are the\n same class of key, were generated with the same program, are of the\n same length, etc.\n\n10)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5?\n\n MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc.\n It provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash,\n of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not\n possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a\n different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus,\n instead of signing the entire message with the sender's private key,\n only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication.\n\n MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often\n used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a\n passphrase interpreter or cookie generator.\n\n MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in\n RFC 1321.\n\n11)  What is PGP?\n\n PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy.\n PGP has been around longer than RIPEM, and works somewhat differently.\n PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way, though PGP does also use RSA.\n\n Some major differences between PGP and RIPEM:\n\n - PGP has more key management features, particularly for users without\n   a direct network connection.\n\n - RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability of\n   working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be compatible\n   with anything other than PGP (in fact, PGP 1.0 is not compatible with\n   PGP 2.0.)\n\n - RIPEM uses RSAREF, a library of RSA routines from RSA Data Security\n   Inc.  RSAREF comes with a license which allows noncommercial use.\n   PGP uses its own implementation of RSA which is not licensed; thus,\n   PKP, the firm holding the U.S. patents on the RSA algorithm, claims\n   that it is a infringement of that patent to make, use or sell PGP in\n   the U.S. or Canada.  In acknowledgement of this, PGP's original\n   author, Phil Zimmermann, says in the documentation:\n\n   #In fact, if you live in the USA, and you are not a Federal agency, \n   #you shouldn't actually run PGP on your computer, because Public\n   #Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software.  PGP is\n   #contraband.  \n\n - Both PGP and RIPEM are export-restricted, and cannot be sent outside\n   the U.S. and Canada.  However, PGP already exists on many ftp sites\n   in Europe and other places.\n\n Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever, the documentation to PGP is\n recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues.\n\n Note that the above facts, both regarding patent and export\n restrictions, are somewhat controversial; many people think it\n shouldn't be that way, and some people interpret various documents\n differently.  Unfortunately, discussions of it on the net inevitably\n seem to produce more heat than light, and probably belong in\n misc.legal.computing.  (See:  \"DISCLAIMER\")\n\n12)  What about RPEM?\n\n RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail.  It was similar to RIPEM,\n but used a public-key cipher invented by Rabin (which is not RSA) in\n an attempt to avoid the patent on RSA.  It was written by Mark\n Riordan, the same author as RIPEM.\n\n Its distribution was halted when, contrary to the beliefs of many\n (including Rabin), Public Key Partners (PKP) claimed that their patent\n was broad enough to cover any public-key cipher whose strength rested\n in the difficulty of factoring products of large primes, not just RSA.\n This claim is not universally accepted by any means, but was not\n challenged for pragmatic reasons.\n\n RPEM is not really used anymore.  It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP.\n\n13)  What is MIME?\n\n MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, and is\n described in RFC 1341.  You can find out about it in the newsgroup\n comp.mail.mime.  How PEM should interact with MIME is not yet entirely\n clear; some people use the stopgap solution of having a MIME type\n application/x-ripem in order to send RIPEM messages as MIME ones.  I\n hope some standards will emerge.  Draft Internet documents exist on\n the matter.\n\n14)  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM...\n\n You may wish to check the companion post \"ripem-attacks\" which\n discusses some of the more obvious attacks on RIPEM's security and\n what procedures will minimize the risk.  RIPEM's main \"weak area\" is\n probably key distribution.\n"

Full\n  descriptions are given in Bennett [BEN87] and Bergen and Caelli\n  [BER91].\n\n  Chris Galas writes: ``Someone awhile back was looking for a way to\n  decrypt WordPerfect document files and I think I have a solution. \n  There is a software company named: Accessdata (87 East 600 South,\n  Orem, UT 84058), 1-800-658-5199 that has a software package that will\n  decrypt any WordPerfect, Lotus 1-2-3, Quatro-Pro, MS Excel and Paradox\n  files. The cost of the package is $185. Steep prices, but if you\n  think your pw key is less than 10 characters, (or 10 char) give them a\n  call and ask for the free demo disk. The demo disk will decrypt files\n  that have a 10 char or less pw key.''\n\n* How do I break a Vigenere (repeated-key) cipher?\n\n  A repeated-key cipher, where the ciphertext is something like the\n  plaintext xor KEYKEYKEYKEY (and so on), is called a Vigenere cipher.\n  If the key is not too long and the plaintext is in English, do the\n  following: \n\n  1. Discover the length of the key by counting coincidences.\n  (See Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].) Trying each displacement of\n  the ciphertext against itself, count those bytes which are equal. \n  If the two ciphertext portions have used the same key, something\n  over 6% of the bytes will be equal. If they have used different\n  key, then less than 0.4% will be equal (assuming random 8-bit bytes\n  of key covering normal ASCII text). The smallest displacement which\n  indicates an equal key is the length of the repeated key.\n\n  2. Shift the text by that length and XOR it with itself. This\n  removes the key and leaves you with text XORed with itself. Since\n  English has about 1 bit of real information per byte, 2 streams of\n  text XORed together has 2 bits of info per 8-bit byte, providing\n  plenty of redundancy for choosing a unique decryption. (And in fact\n  one stream of text XORed with itself has just 1 bit per byte.)\n\n  If the key is short, it might be even easier to treat this as a\n  standard polyalphabetic substitution. All the old cryptanalysis\n  texts show how to break those. It's possible with those methods, in\n  the hands of an expert, if there's only ten times as much text as key.\n  See, for example, Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].\n\n* How do I send encrypted mail under UNIX? [PGP, RIPEM, PEM, ...]\n\n  Here's one popular method, using the des command:\n\n    cat file | compress | des private_key | uuencode | mail\n\n  Meanwhile, there is a de jure Internet standard in the works called\n  PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail). It is described in RFCs 1421 through\n  1424. To join the PEM mailing list, contact pem-dev-request@tis.com.\n  There is a beta version of PEM being tested at the time of this\n  writing.\n\n  There are also two programs available in the public domain for encrypting\n  mail: PGP and RIPEM.  Both are available by FTP.  Each has its own\n  newsgroup: alt.security.pgp and alt.security.ripem.  Each has its own FAQ\n  as well.\n\n  PGP is most commonly used outside the USA since it uses the RSA algorithm\n  without a license and RSA's patent is valid only (or at least primarily)\n  in the USA.\n\n  RIPEM is most commonly used inside the USA since it uses the RSAREF which\n  is freely available within the USA but not available for shipment outside\n  the USA.\n\n  Since both programs use a secret key algorithm for encrypting the body of\n  the message (PGP used IDEA; RIPEM uses DES) and RSA for encrypting the\n  message key, they should be able to interoperate freely.  Although there\n  have been repeated calls for each to understand the other's formats and\n  algorithm choices, no interoperation is available at this time (as far as\n  we know).\n\n* Is the UNIX crypt command secure?\n\n  No. See [REE84]. There is a program available called cbw (crypt\n  breaker's workbench) which can be used to do ciphertext-only attacks\n  on files encrypted with crypt. One source for CBW is [FTPCB].\n\n* How do I use compression with encryption?\n\n  A number of people have proposed doing perfect compression followed by\n  some simple encryption method (e.g., XOR with a repeated key).\n\n  Unfortunately, you can only compress perfectly if you know the exact\n  distribution of possible inputs. For all practical purposes it's\n  impossible to describe ``the typical English text'' beyond coarse\n  characteristics such as single-letter frequencies. You can build up\n  more and more sophisticated models of your inputs, but if the enemy\n  has a slightly more accurate model, he'll be able to find some\n  redundancy in your compressed output.\n\n  Note that nearly all practical compression schemes, unless they\n  have been designed with cryptography in mind, produce output that\n  actually starts off with high redundancy. For example, the output of\n  UNIX compress begins with a well-known three-byte ``magic number''\n  that can serve as an entering wedge for cryptanalysis.\n  \n  This is not to say that compression before encryption is inherently a\n  bad idea; it just has to be done very, very carefully, and by no means\n  removes the need for strong encryption.\n\n  Compression after encryption is silly.\n\n* Is there an unbreakable cipher?\n\n  Yes. The one-time pad is unbreakable; see part 4. Unfortunately the\n  one-time pad requires secure distribution of as much key material as\n  plaintext.\n\n  Of course, a cryptosystem need not be utterly unbreakable to be\n  useful. Rather, it needs to be strong enough to resist attacks by\n  likely enemies for whatever length of time the data it protects is\n  expected to remain valid.\n\n* What does ``random'' mean in cryptography?\n\n  Cryptographic applications demand much more out of a pseudorandom\n  number generator than most applications. For a source of bits to be\n  cryptographically random, it must be computationally impossible to\n  predict what the Nth random bit will be given complete knowledge of\n  the algorithm or hardware generating the stream and the sequence of\n  0th through N-1st bits, for all N up to the lifetime of the source.\n\n  A software generator (also known as pseudo-random) has the function\n  of expanding a truly random seed to a longer string of apparently\n  random bits.  This seed must be large enough not to be guessed by\n  the opponent.  Ideally, it should also be truly random (perhaps\n  generated by a hardware random number source).\n\n  Those who have Sparcstation 1 workstations could, for example,\n  generate random numbers using the audio input device as a source of\n  entropy, by not connecting anything to it.  For example,\n\n\tcat /dev/audio | compress - >foo\n\n  gives a file of high entropy (not random but with much randomness in\n  it).  One can then encrypt that file using part of itself as a key,\n  for example, to convert that seed entropy into a pseudo-random\n  string.\n\n  When looking for hardware devices to provide this entropy, it is\n  important really to measure the entropy rather than just assume that\n  because it looks complicated to a human, it must be \"random\".  For\n  example, disk operation completion times sound like they might be\n  unpredictable (to many people) but a spinning disk is much like a\n  clock and its output completion times are relatively low in entropy.\n\n* What is the unicity point (a.k.a. unicity distance)?\n\n  See [SHA49]. The unicity distance is an approximation to that amount\n  of ciphertext such that the sum of the real information (entropy) in\n  the corresponding source text and encryption key equals the number\n  of ciphertext bits used. Ciphertexts significantly longer than this\n  can be shown probably to have a unique decipherment. This is used to\n  back up a claim of the validity of a ciphertext-only cryptanalysis. \n  Ciphertexts significantly shorter than this are likely to have\n  multiple, equally valid decryptions and therefore to gain security\n  from the opponent's difficulty choosing the correct one.\n\n  Unicity distance, like all statistical or information-theoretic\n  measures, does not make deterministic predictions but rather gives\n  probabilistic results: namely, the minimum amount of ciphertext\n  for which it is likely that there is only a single intelligible\n  plaintext corresponding to the ciphertext, when all possible keys\n  are tried for the decryption. Working cryptologists don't normally\n  deal with unicity distance as such. Instead they directly determine\n  the likelihood of events of interest.\n\n  Let the unicity distance of a cipher be D characters. If fewer than\n  D ciphertext characters have been intercepted, then there is not\n  enough information to distinguish the real key from a set of\n  possible keys. DES has a unicity distance of 17.5 characters,\n  which is less than 3 ciphertext blocks (each block corresponds to\n  8 ASCII characters). This may seem alarmingly low at first, but\n  the unicity distance gives no indication of the computational work\n  required to find the key after approximately D characters have been\n  intercepted.\n\n  In fact, actual cryptanalysis seldom proceeds along the lines used\n  in discussing unicity distance. (Like other measures such as key\n  size, unicity distance is something that guarantees insecurity if\n  it's too small, but doesn't guarantee security if it's high.) Few\n  practical cryptosystems are absolutely impervious to analysis; all\n  manner of characteristics might serve as entering ``wedges'' to crack\n  some cipher messages. However, similar information-theoretic\n  considerations are occasionally useful, for example, to determine a\n  recommended key change interval for a particular cryptosystem.\n  Cryptanalysts also employ a variety of statistical and\n  information-theoretic tests to help guide the analysis in the most\n  promising directions.\n\n  Unfortunately, most literature on the application of information\n  statistics to cryptanalysis remains classified, even the seminal\n  1940 work of Alan Turing (see [KOZ84]). For some insight into the\n  possibilities, see [KUL68] and [GOO83].\n\n* What is key management and why is it important?\n\n  One of the fundamental axioms of cryptography is that the enemy is in\n  full possession of the details of the general cryptographic system,\n  and lacks only the specific key data employed in the encryption. (Of\n  course, one would assume that the CIA does not make a habit of telling\n  Mossad about its cryptosystems, but Mossad probably finds out anyway.)\n  Repeated use of a finite amount of key provides redundancy that can\n  eventually facilitate cryptanalytic progress. Thus, especially in\n  modern communication systems where vast amounts of information are\n  transferred, both parties must have not only a sound cryptosystem but\n  also enough key material to cover the traffic.\n\n  Key management refers to the distribution, authentication, and\n  handling of keys.\n\n  A publicly accessible example of modern key management technology\n  is the STU III secure telephone unit, which for classified use\n  employs individual coded ``Crypto Ignition Keys'' and a central Key\n  Management Center operated by NSA. There is a hierarchy in that\n  certain CIKs are used by authorized cryptographic control\n  personnel to validate the issuance of individual traffic keys and\n  to perform installation/maintenance functions, such as the\n  reporting of lost CIKs.\n\n  This should give an inkling of the extent of the key management\n  problem. For public-key systems, there are several related issues,\n  many having to do with ``whom do you trust?''\n\n* Can I use pseudo-random or chaotic numbers as a key stream?\n\n  Chaotic equations and fractals produce an apparent randomness from\n  relatively compact generators. Perhaps the simplest example is a\n  linear congruential sequence, one of the most popular types of random\n  number generators, where there is no obvious dependence between seeds\n  and outputs. Unfortunately the graph of any such sequence will, in a\n  high enough dimension, show up as a regular lattice. Mathematically\n  this lattice corresponds to structure which is notoriously easy for\n  cryptanalysts to exploit. More complicated generators have more\n  complicated structure, which is why they make interesting pictures---\n  but a cryptographically strong sequence will have no computable\n  structure at all.\n\n  See [KNU81], exercise 3.5-7; [REE77]; and [BOY89].\n\n* What is the correct frequency list for English letters?\n\n  There are three answers to this question, each slightly deeper than\n  the one before. You can find the first answer in various books:\n  namely, a frequency list computed directly from a certain sample of\n  English text. Of course any such list will be ``correctly'' computed,\n  but exactly which list you get depends on which sample was taken.\n\n  The second answer is that the question doesn't make sense. What do\n  you mean by ``English letters''? The ``English language'' is not a\n  fixed, finite, closed object that can be exactly characterized. It\n  has changed over time; it is different between different authors.\n  Any particular message will have different statistics from those of\n  the language as a whole.\n\n  The third answer is that yes, no particular message is going to have\n  exactly the same characteristics as English in general, but for all\n  reasonable statistical uses these slight discrepancies won't matter.\n  In fact there's an entire field called ``Bayesian statistics'' (other\n  buzzwords are ``maximum entropy methods'' and ``maximum likelihood\n  estimation'') which studies questions like ``What's the chance that a\n  text with these letter frequencies is in English?'' and comes up with\n  reasonably robust answers.\n\n  So make your own list from your own samples of English text. It will\n  be good enough for practical work, if you use it properly.\n\n* What is the Enigma?\n\n  ``For a project in data security we are looking for sources of\n  information about the German Enigma code and how it was broken by\n  the British during WWII.''\n\n  See [WEL82], [DEA85], [KOZ84], [HOD83], [KAH91].\n\n* How do I shuffle cards?\n\n  Card shuffling is a special case of the permutation of an array of\n  values, using a random or pseudo-random function.  All possible output\n  permutations of this process should be equally likely.  To do this, you\n  need a random function (modran(x)) which will produce a uniformly\n  distributed random integer in the interval [0..x-1].  Given that\n  function, you can shuffle with the following [C] code: (assuming ARRLTH\n  is the length of array arr[] and swap() interchanges values at the two\n  addresses given)\n\n  for ( n = ARRLTH-1; n > 0 ; n-- ) swap( &arr[modran( n+1 )], &arr[n] ) ;\n\n  modran(x) can not be achieved exactly with a simple (ranno() % x) since\n  ranno()'s interval may not be divisible by x, although in most cases the\n  error will be very small.  To cover this case, one can take ranno()'s\n  modulus mod x, call that number y, and if ranno() returns a value less\n  than y, go back and get another ranno() value.\n\n\n* Can I foil S/W pirates by encrypting my CD-ROM?\n\n  Someone will frequently express the desire to publish a CD-ROM with\n  possibly multiple pieces of software, perhaps with each encrypted\n  separately, and will want to use different keys for each user (perhaps\n  even good for only a limited period of time) in order to avoid piracy.\n\n  As far as we know, this is impossible, since there is nothing in standard\n  PC or workstation hardware which uniquely identifies the user at the\n  keyboard.  If there were such an identification, then the CD-ROM could be\n  encrypted with a key based in part on the one sold to the user and in\n  part on the unique identifier.  However, in this case the CD-ROM is one\n  of a kind and that defeats the intended purpose.\n\n  If the CD-ROM is to be encrypted once and then mass produced, there must\n  be a key (or set of keys) for that encryption produced at some stage in\n  the process.  That key is useable with any copy of the CD-ROM's data.\n  The pirate needs only to isolate that key and sell it along with the\n  illegal copy.\n\n\n* Can you do automatic cryptanalysis of simple ciphers?\n\n  schneier@chinet.chi.il.us (Bruce Schneier) says: AccessData of Orem,\n  Utah sells products that break the password scheme of a number of\n  popular Macintosh and PC software packages.  Their telephone number\n  is (801) 224-6970\n\n  No PD software has been cited but there are many papers on the\n  subject....\n\n  Peleg, S. and Rosenfeld, A.  \"Breaking Substitution Ciphers Using a\n  Relaxation Algorithm\" Comm.

The original article\nhas reappeared, so:\n\n    The President today announced a new initiative that will bring\n    the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary\n    program to improve the security and privacy of telephone\n    communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law\n    enforcement.\n\nHmm, telephone communications could indeed include end-to-end encryption on\nordinary landlines.\n\n    The initiative will involve the creation of new products to\n    accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure\n    telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.\n\nBut the next paragraph says telecoms networks and wireless communications\nlinks.\n\nOK, it's far from clear exactly what Cripple (what an apposite anagram) will\nbe applied to, but the reason Joe Public wants secure comms is to stop\npeople listening in to his cellular or cordless phones (and he wouldn't\neven be bothered about that were it not for Wingnut and Squidqy's\nmisfortunes).\n\nYes, Cripple *might* be for end-to-end encyption, dropping to clear\nwhen the other end doesn't have Cripple.  But then a cordless-to-ordinary\nconversation would be in clear leaving the cordless end just as vulnerable\nas at present.  Nope, I suspect that Cripple will only be used on radio\nlinks.\n\nOK, it's possible `telecommunications networks' could mean `ordinary phone\nlines', but I'm betting it means the microwave links used by the telcos.\n\nMy apologies if I'm wrong, particularly if the turgid Press Release makes it\nclear that I'm wrong and I missed it, but as far as I can see it was full of\nobfuscation, and anyone expecting end-to-end encryption is in for a surprise\n(IMHO).\n\n\nBTW, Graham, I've posted questions to alt.security.pgp and not seen any\nreplies/followups from outside Europe - how about you?  Have I made it into\neveryone's kill file, or is there some problem?\n\n- --Paul\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: 2.2\n\niQCVAgUBK9SPBmv14aSAK9PNAQGJBwP/ZoKyrm0gemlyYsNj8bqoH8l8qLJoMRBo\neOCClpKsTavebtdCLIGqHNzoWC6Ar2K1blIbpUa2tWnqwRGVa15OgOc7XXKJJ093\nyb7P/vWvQbXYiA6zDJ5zkQsDeP7X6ckIDVDRz5CdIS+oNXtiOtHk3s3B3wjQBjCU\nvks8KOV8gfg=\n=gVy0\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n"

Supposedly, the government rethought this\nsoon after, and Rogers was convieniently forgotten.\n\nThe bottom line is that all antennas that are grounded send HALF of\ntheir signal THRU the ground. The half that travels thru space is\nquickly dissapated (by the square of the distance), but that which\ntravels thru the ground does not disapate at all. Furthermore,\nthe published data showed that when noise drowned out regular\nreception, the underground antennas would recieve virtually noise-free.\n\nIF you find this hard to believe, then refer to the work of the\nman who INVENTED wireless: Tesla.

The civil precision is about 20 to 30m (correct me, if I'm wrong),  \nthough, it may be insufficiant for mapping buildings.

Around the base of the hourglass is a\nring of water towers.  Warm river water, coming from the steam condenser\nin the plant, is sprayed over louvres.  The draft being pulled through\nthe tower cools the water by both evaporation and convection.  The\nsensible heat extracted from the cooling water is the driving force for\ndraft generation.\n\nIt should be noted that the hourglass-shaped cooling towers are used on\nboth fossile and nuclear plants.  It should also be noted that at \nlocations where water is plentiful, the cooling towers are only used part\ntime, when the discharge temperature would exceed some release limit.\nIt was once thought that the warm discharge water was damaging to fish.\nFishermen know that is thoroughly incorrect.  Nontheless, stringent,\nusually state, regulations remain in some instances.  Since it typically\ntakes 60,000 hp worth of pumping to move the volume of water needed \nto cool a 1000 MWe plant, the cost of using the towers is not insignificant.\n-- \nJohn De Armond, WD4OQC               |Interested in high performance mobility?  \nPerformance Engineering Magazine(TM) | Interested in high tech and computers? \nMarietta, Ga                         | Send ur snail-mail address to \njgd@dixie.com                        | perform@dixie.com for a free sample mag\nLee Harvey Oswald: Where are ya when we need ya?\n"

People with early life hernias\nare felt to have a congenital sack that promotes the formation of hernias.\nThe hernias of later life may be more associated with chronic straining.  \nHowever, the risk of damage to the intestine without an operation is \nhigh enough that it ought to be repaired.

Unlike the conventional large \nVHF radars, in which output power of a large vacuum tube is distributed \nto individual antenna elements, each of 475 solid state power amplifier \nfeeds each antenna element. This system configuration enables very fast \nbeam steering as well as various flexible operations by dividing the \nantenna into independent subarrays, because phase shift and signal \ndivision/combination are performed at a low signal level using \nelectronic devices under control of a computer network. The antenna \nbeam can be switched within 10 microsec to any direction within the \nzenith angle of 30 deg. Since a precise phase alignment of each element \nis crucial to realize the excellent performance of this system, careful \ncalibration of the output phase of each power amplifier and antenna \nelement was carried out. Among various aircraft which may be used for \nthis purpose artificial satellites have an advantage of being able to \nmake a long term monitoring with the same system. An antenna pattern \nmonitoring system for the MU radar was developed using the scientific \nsatellite OHZORA (EXOS-C). A receiver named MUM (MU radar antenna \nMonitor) on board the satellite measures a CW signal of 100 to 400 \nwatts transmitted from the MU radar. The principle of the measurement \nand results are discussed.\n\n\nEquatorial radar system\nFUKAO, SHOICHIRO;  TSUDA, TOSHITAKA; SATO, TORU; KATO, SUSUMU\n(Kyoto University, Uji, Japan)\n(COSPAR, IAGA, SCOSTEP, et al., Plenary Meeting, 27th,\nWorkshops and Symposium on the Earth's Middle Atmosphere,\nEspoo, Finland, July 18-29, 1988) Advances in Space Research\n(ISSN 0273-1177), vol. 10, no. 10, 1990, p. 151-154.\n     A large clear air radar with the sensitivity of an incoherent \nscatter radar for observing the whole equatorial atmosphere up to 1000 \nkm altitude is now being designed in Japan. The radar will be built in \nPontianak, West Kalimantan, Indonesia (0.03 deg N, 109.29 deg E). The \nsystem is a 47-MHz monostatic Doppler radar with an active phased array \nconfiguration similar to that of the MU radar in Japan, which has been \nin successful operation since 1983. It will have a PA product of about \n3 x 10 to the 9th W sq m (P = average transmitter power, A = effective \nantenna aperture) with a sensitivity of approximately 10 times that of \nthe MU radar. This system configuration enables pulse-to-pulse beam \nsteering within 20 deg from the zenith. As is the case of the MU radar, \na variety of operations will be made feasible under the supervision of \nthe radar controller. A brief description of the system configuration \nis presented. \n\n"

And to Holy Mary, Virgin is invariably added, for that Holy Woman\n    remains undefiled.\n                -- St. Epiphanus of Salamis, \"Panacea against all heresies\",\n                   between A.D. 374-377.\n\n    We surely cannot deny that you were right in correcting the doctrine\n    about children of Mary ... For the Lord Jesus would not have chosen\n    to be born of a virgin if He had judged that she would be so incontinent\n    as to taint the birthplace of the Body of the Lord, home of the Eternal\n    King, with the seed of human intercourse.  Anyone who proposes this is\n    merely proposing ... that Christ could not be born of a virgin.\n                -- Pope St. Siricius, Letter to Anysius, Bishop of \n                   Thessalonica, A.D. 392\n\nNote that St. Augustine's conversion to Christianity was in A.D. 387.  I\ndon't know offhand when his election as bishop of Hippo was, but I'm quite\nsure it was after 392.  The belief in Mary's perpetual virginity originated\nlong before Augustine's time.  We hold that it originated with the \nApostles.\n\nStrictly speaking, however, Mary's perpetual virginity is independent\nof her Immaculate Conception.  Mary could have been Immaculately \nConceived and not remained a virgin; she could have remained a virgin\nand not been Immaculately Conceived.\n\n>Since we also had this notion of original sin, ie. that man is born with\n>a predisposition to sin, and since Mary did not have this predisposition\n>because she did not ever sin, she didn't have original sin.  When science\n>discovered the process of conception, the next step was to assume that\n>Mary was conceived without original sin, the Immaculate Conception.\n\nNo.  It has been held in the Church since ancient times that original\nsin was transmitted at conception, when a person's life begins.\nBiology had nothing to do with it.  Prayerfully reflecting on the\ntruth of Mary's sinlessness, and the means by which God could have\nachieved this, the Church arrived at the truth of the Immaculate\nConception.  Thus, the Immaculate Conception is not a new doctrine,\nbut the logical result of our understanding of two old ones.\n\nThe celebration of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception itself was\ngiven by Pope Sixtus IV (1471-84) and the Feast was made a precept\nfeast of the Church by Pope Clement XI (1700-21).\n\n>Mary at that time appeared to a girl named Bernadette at Lourdes.  She \n>refered to herself as the Immaculate Conception.  Since a nine year old \n>would have no way of knowing about the doctrine, the apparition was deemed\n>to be true and it sealed the case for the doctrine.\n\nNo.  First of all, Lourdes is private revelation, and doctrine is not\nbased on private revelation.  The most that private revelation can do\nis enhance and deepen our understanding of existing public revelation,\nwhich ended with the death of St. John the Apostle.\n\nSecond, the \"case for the doctrine\" was irreformably sealed in 1854 \nwith the ex cathedra promulgation of the Bull \"Ineffabilis Deus\" by\nPope Pius IX.  This meant that the doctrine was formally recognized as\na dogma; a dogma, by definition, cannot change and is required to be\nbelieved by the faithful.\n\nThe apparition at Lourdes happened in 1858, four years later.  The most\nthat might be claimed is that Lourdes gave the infallible proclamation\nof 1854 a sort of heavenly stamp of approval, but the Church has never\nclaimed that, nor shall she.\n\nIn Christ's Peace,\n\nBrad Kaiser\n(bradk@isdgsm.eurpd.csg.mot.com)\n\n\t  Those who trust in Him shall understand truth,\n\t  and the faithful shall abide with Him in love;\n\t  Because grace and mercy are with His holy ones,\n\t  and His care is with His elect.\n\t\t    -- Wis 3:9 [NAB]\n"

Sex, or Christianity?\n\nI'm afraid I see that question as very tendentious.  Try rephrasing it:\n\n\tWhat's more important to Christians?  Love of God or love\n\tof other human beings?\n\nto which of course the only conceivable answer is that the one is like\nthe other.  I am *deeply* suspicious of any \"flavor\" of Christianity\nwhich would elevate one clause of the Great Commandment to a \"priority\"\nover the other such as to claim a conflict.  True, we are told to let\nthe dead bury the dead, to \"hate\" family rather than let it keep us from\nfollowing Christ.  But the dichotomy here is not one between love of our\nfellows and love of God, but of allowing *social* constructs to blind us\nto the presense of God.  It is particularly satanic to twist love of God\nin such a manner as to become an excuse to treat others as on a different\nlevel than the one who is so caught up in \"love\" of God.\n\nThe trouble comes in the relation of human love and human sex.  Yes, it\nhas sometimes been the case that the Church has \"taught\" that all sex\nwas nasty, evil, sinful stuff.  But when man and wife leave their parental\nhomes to become helpmates, living in one flesh, it is the sex that is the\nvehicle of becoming \"one flesh\" (if you doubt me, read St. Paul on what\nis wrong with frequenting prostitutes :-)).  Less provocatively, what I\nmean is just this: sexual bonding is a deeply founded aspect of our social\ninteraction, and in particular is the foundation of the institution of\nmarriage, so that unlike with many mammals, human males remain with and\nfoster the children they beget and support their children's mothers.\nThis is the schema behind Genesis 2:18-24 (and behind Jesus' citation of\nthat passage.)\n\n\t[ I observe, by the way, that not all human males in fact do as\n\t  I have just described; but another thing that characterizes\n\t  human societies is our raising of *non*begotten children, not\n\t  only orphans and adoptees and the like, but products of the\n\t  quite common infidelities of humans to their spouses. We are\n\t  in this not unique in the animal world, but the full extent of\n\t  social consequences and implications is most intricate for us. ]\n\nYes, of course it sometimes goes \"wrong\" -- like all else we do, it is\ninfected with sin, and you find married \"couples\" where there is no bond,\nand people so deliriously addicted to the initial stages of sexual bond\nformation (the \"infatuation\", \"falling in love\" phase) that they break\nany forming bond in order to keep stepping over the threshold of the deep\nunity God has prepared for us, and stepping back out again right away.\nSatan may indeed *use* sex as a very handy tool to corrupt human love --\nbut in the Edenic creation, that is not its nature, and with God's grace\nunder the power of Christ to make all things new it need not be a problem\nfor Christians (though we must be vigilant, even in Christ, as the devil\nis watchful, prowling around like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour.)\n\nSo, returning to the original question, what is more important to STRAIGHT\nChristians?  Sex, or Christianity?  Paul, clearly, tended to think that\nsex was at best a distraction from Christianity (though to be charitable\nto him, his context was in expectation of immediate parousia, so that the\nhard TASKS of a married union -- the lifelong building and adaptation to\neach other -- seemed somehow to undercut the \"proper\" preparation for an\nimmediate eschaton.  Since we *do not* know the hour of return, we should\nact *both* with instant readiness for that *and* with a commitiment to our\nmates that proposes a long lifetime together.  And telling people *not* to\nbond in such a perspective strikes me as crippling us in the second clause\nof the the commandment to love.  I would claim that only a very few saints\nhave the CAPACITY to deeply love (without sexual tinges or complication,\nmind you) their fellow human beings unless they have had a deeply spiritual\nlife in married union growing together as one flesh -- and that means in\nthe type case, with a persistent and continued sexual relationship.  We\nare human, and little good comes of trying to \"mortify the flesh\" to the\npoint of pretending to be otherwise, pretending NOT to be sexual beings.\n\n>Christianity I would hope.  Would they be willing to forgo sex\n>completely, in order to avoid being a stumbling block to others,\n\nIt depends entirely on context.  If that context is major hypocrisy\non the part of those who find us \"stumbling blocks\" I am much less of\na mind to efface myself so that they can pontificate about MY sins.\n\nThere are some people for whom a life of celibacy is a spritual gift,\nand maybe even a victory against a to-them troubling sexual urge that\nseems to them to lead only to sin.  Nothing I say should ever be read\nas demeaning such a gift.  Nor the even rarer gift of love for all our\nconspecifics, and indeed for all God's creation, that can develop to\nthe full *without* the tutoring of a spousal/helpmate marriage founded\nin sex.  But there is a difference between spiritual gifts and penance;\ntelling people that they HAVE to have a particular gift (or else? what?)\nis fraught with manipulation and disregard of the differences of our\nspiritual endowments from God.  To one person is given the gift of\nspeaking in toungues, to another intepretation of toungues; to yet\nanother prophecy; and to still another teaching.  The notion that some\n*particular* gift is required of *all* is one of the earliest heresies.\n-- \nMichael L.

There many people alive today who were born in \n>a city called Konstantinoupolis. \n\nI know it doesn't make sense, but since when is 'Napoleon' about\nsense, anyway? Further striking bigoted and racist attitude of \ncertain Greeks still exists in our day. Most Greeks insist even \ntoday, that the 537 year-old capital of the Ottoman Empire should \nbe called not by its rightful name of Istanbul, but by its half \na millennium-old moniker 'Cons*(whatever).'\n\nEveryone knows that New York City was once called 'New Amsterdam'\nbut Dutch people do not persist on calling it that today. The name \nof Stalingrad too is long gone, replaced by Volgagrad. China's\nPeking traded its name for Beiging long ago. Ciudad Trujillo\nof the Dominican Republic is now Santa Domingo. Zimbabve's\nold colonial capital Salisburry became Harrare. These changes\nhave all been accepted officially by everyone in the world.\n\nBut, Greeks are still determined on calling the Turkish Istanbul \nby the name of 'Cons*.'\n\nHow can one explain this total intransigence? What makes Greeks\nso different from other mortals? 18-year-old questionable\ndemocracy? Why don't they seem to reconcile with the fact,\nfor instance, that Istanbul changed hands 537 years ago in\n1453 AD, and that this predates the discovery of the New \nWorld, by 39 years. The declaration of U.S. independence\nin 1776 will come 284 years later.\n\nShouldn't then, half a millennium be considered enough time for \n'Cons*' to be called a Turkish city? Where is the logic in the \nGreek reasoning, if there is any? How long can one sit on the \nlaurels of an ancient civilization? Ancient Greece does not exist, \nany more than any other 16 civilizations that existed on the soil \nof Anatolia.\n\nThese undereducated 'wieneramus' live with an illusion. It \nis the same mentality which allows them to rationalize\nthat Cyprus is a Greek Island. No history book shows\nthat it ever was. It belonged to the Ottoman Turks 'lock,\nstock and barrel' for a period of well over 300 years.\n\nIn fact, prior to the Turks' acquisition of it, following\nbloody naval battles with the Venetians in 1570 AD, the\nisland of Cyprus belonged, invariably, to several nations:\n\nThe Assyrians, the Sumerians, the Phoenicians, the Egyptians,\nthe Ottoman Turks, of course in that order, owned it as \ntheir territory. But, it has never been the possession\nof the government of Greece - not even for one day -\nin the history of the world. Moreover, Cyprus is\nlocated 1500 miles from the Greek mainland, but only \n40 miles from Turkiye's southern coastline.\n\nSaddam Hussein claims that Kuwait was once Iraqi\nterritory and the Greek Cypriot government and \nthe terrorist Greek governments think that Cyprus\nalso was once part of the Greek hegemony.\n\nThose 'Arromdians' involved in this grandiose hallucination\nshould wake up from their sweet daydreams and confront \nreality. Again, wishful thinking is unproductive, only \nfacts count.\n\nAs for Selanik,\n\n  <<Those Jews who survived these assaults in Southeastern Europe fled\n  particularly to Salonica, whose Jewish population increased substantially\n  as a result, from 28,000 in 1876 to 90,000 in 1908, more than half the\n  total population, though even there increased persecution by local Greeks\n  led many Jews to flee elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire, particularly to\n  the great port of Izmir.\n\n  Despite all the pressure from Ottomans and foreign Jews alike, the ritual\n  murders and other assaults by Christians on Jews went on and on. Greek\n  efforts to decimate the Jewish population of Salonica culminated in 1912\n  and 1913, following Greek conquest of Salonica during the first Balkan War,\n  when many of its Jews, were either killed or terrorized into leaving...>>\n\n  <<Though Greece was obligated by the post World War I treaties to allow\n  Jews and other minorities to use their own languages in education and to\n  practice their religions without hindrance, a law was issued in 1923\n  which forbad all inhabitants from working on Sunday, stimulating a new\n  Jewish exodus as it was intended to do. Between 1932 and 1934 there was a\n  series of anti-Semitic riots in Salonica, with the Cambel quarter, where\n  most of the remaining Jews lived, being burned to the ground. This\n  was followed by regulations requiring the use of Greek and prohibiting\n  Hebrew and Judea-Spanish in the Jewish schools. A start was made also\n  on expropriating the land of the principal Jewish cemetery in Salonica\n  for use by the new University in order to derive the Jews out [47]. By\n  killing and driving out large numbers of Jews, the Greeks left a\n  substantial Greek majority in the city for the first time, and starting\n  Salonica Jewry on the way to its final decimation by the Nazis during the\n  occupation of Greece starting in 1941.\n\n  Salonica and Izmir of course were not the only places of refuge for\n  Jewish refugees entering the Empire during its last century of existence.\n  Istanbul, Edirne, and other parts of Rumelia and Anatolia received\n  thousands more. Nor were Jews the only refugees received and helped by\n  the government of the Sultan. Thousands of Muslims accompanied them in\n  flight from similar persecutions wherever Balkan christian states gained\n  independence or expanded. The Russian conquest of the Crimea and the\n  Caucasus starting in the late eighteenth century, and particularly during\n  and after the Crimean War, combined with the same independence movements\n  in Southeastern Europe that had caused so much suffering and flight among\n  its Jews caused thousands of helpless, ill, and poverty-stricken Muslim\n  refugees to accompany them into the ever shrinking boundaries of the\n  Ottoman Empire, with the Istanbul government struggling mightly but vainly\n  to house and feed them as best it could. From 1850 to 1864 as many as\n  800,000 Crimean Tatars, Circassians, and other Muslims from north and\n  east of the Black Sea had entered Anatolia alone, as many as 200,000 more\n  came during the next twenty years, while 474,389 refugees entered in 1876-\n  1877 as a result of the Ottoman wars with Russia and the Balkan states,\n  with an equal number gaining refuge in the European portions of the\n  Empire.>>\n\n[47] Robert Mantran, 'La structure sociale de la communaute juive de\n  Salonqiue a la fin du dix-neuvieme siecle', RH no.534 (1980), 391-92;\n  Nehama VII, 762; Joseph Nehama (Salonica) to AIU (Paris) no.2868/2,\n  12 May 1903 (AIU Archives I-C-43); and no.2775, 10 January 1900 (AIU\n  Archives I-C-41), describing daily battles between Jewish and Greek\n  children in the streets of Salonica.

However,\n\nThis is quite a misrepresentation.  After WWI, many Bosnian Muslims were\nkilled and their land taken over by Serbs, and the motive was plunder,\nnot some fictitious \"supression of rebellion.\"  Even earlier, one can\npoint to the destruction of mosques in Serbia itself and expulsion of\nMuslims.  Here is what Dr. Vaso Cubrilovic, political adviser to the\nSerbian monarchic regime, says in his memorandum \"The Expulsion of the\nArnauts\" which he presented to the royal government of Stojadinovic\non March 7, 1937, in Belgrade:\n\n   The Mode of Removal\n   -------------------\n\n   [ describes how expulsion of ethnic Albanians from Kosova is to proceed\n   through state terror and \"private initiative\", i.e. Chetnik plunder: ]\n\n   Private initiative, too, can assist greatly in this direction.  We should\n   distribute weapons to our colonists, as need be.  The old forms of Chetnik\n   action should be organized and secretly assisted.  [...]\n   ...the whole affair should be presented as a conflict between clans and,\n   if need be, ascribed to economic reasons.  Finally, local riots can be\n   incited.  These will be bloodily suppressed with the clans and the\n   Chetniks, rather than the army.\n\n   There remains one more means, WHICH SERBIA EMPLOYED WITH GREAT PRACTICAL\n   EFFECT AFTER 1878, that is, by secretly burning down Albanian villages\n   and city quarters.\n\n(Emphasis above is mine.)  These events in Serbia itself forced out virtually\nall Muslims during late 19th century.  This policy of state terrorism\nagainst Muslims, aided by Chetnik \"private initiative,\" has continued in WWII\nand today.  For example, Muhamed Hadzijahic in his book \"Od tradicije do \nidentiteta: Geneza nacionalnog pitanja bosanskih Muslimana\" (Sarajevo:\nSvjetlost, 1974) writes (pg. 235) how Serbs killed a Muslim in Foca\nin WWII even though he claimed to be a Serbian patriot, explaining\ntheir action as follows:\n\n   \"Inasmuch as you were a Serb, you sullied the Serb name, because you\n   are a Turk [i.e. Muslim].  And since you helped us, we shall not\n   torture you.\"\n\nso the shot him instead of cutting his throat.  In the past year, Serbs\nhave repeated the slaughter of Muslim residents of Foca.  Destruction\nof mosques, including priceless historical monuments, completes the\neradication of the Muslim presence from territories claimed by Serbs.\n\n\n>>I strongly dispute your notion that Croats had a similar older agenda,\n>>in fact, for the past century or two, Croats and Muslims have seen\n>>themselves as having a lot in common, and they generally had friendly\n>>relations.  Your suggestion that Croat-Muslim relationship is \n>>anything like Serb-Muslim relationship is completely wrong.\n>>\n>>To say that Croats and Muslims have a lot in common does not imply\n>>they are not separate peoples.  ....\n>\n>\tHow touching.  I have nearly cried while I read this.  Unfortunately,\n>\tmostly untrue.\n\nWhich part do you claim is untrue?  Explain yourself, or withdraw your claim.\n\n>\tCroats from Croatia mostly had no contacts with Muslims, since they\n>\twere mostly \"dealt with extreme preudice\" long time ago. However \n>\tone of the main agendas is turning Bosnia into purely Catholic state.\n\nCroatia never had many Muslim citizens for historical reasons, because it\nwas not a part of the Ottoman Empire.  The last major battles between\nAustro-Hungarian monarchy and the Ottoman Empire in Croatia were at the\nend of the 17th century.  Need I remind you that modern Croatian nationalism\ncame into being with Dr. Ante Starcevic, who saw Bosnian Muslims as the\nbest Croats, so much so that in 1853 he contemplated moving his operations \nto Sarajevo?  You are confusing clericalist Croatianism with Croatian\nnationalism here.   Political nationalism has always been stronger.  As\nfor your other theories, you are clearly overjoyed that Croat-Muslim\nalliance in Bosnia-Herzegovina is now in trouble.  Arguments such as\nyours are clearly intended to create and deepen this split.  \n\n>\tI should add few more things.  A.J. Evans, in his \"On Foot Through\n>\tB&H\" describes that Catholic clergy in the last century was \n>\tapparently more scared by Serbs, then by Turks, because Serbs were\n>\tgrowing stronger and, unlike Turks, represented great danger for\n>\tidea of Catholic Bosnia.  President Tudjman clearly states in \n>\this book that Muslims do not exist as a separate nation from \n>\tCroats and Serbs, and he many times suggested, even in interviewes to\n>\tforeign papers, that solution is to split Bosnia.\n> \n>\tJosip knows this and he is only working on the image of Croatia.\n\nIn international relations 101 you'll learn that unless weak unite to\ncounterbalance the strong player, soon they are taken over and that's the\nend of them.  Balance of power thinking has brought together Croats\nand Bosnian Muslims.  This is only natural; all other alignments are\nunstable.  I'm working on pointing out this basic fact: Croats and\nMuslims have been aware of it for as long as Serbia has existed.  \nYou are wrong if you think only \"image\" is at stake here.  Croatia has\na deep interest in her alliance with Bosnian Muslims, and vice versa.  \n\nI think Tudjman understands this, although he does not have much choice \nat this point.  Tensions should have been defused better earlier, before \nany open confrontation developed.  Although I still think Croatia will\nsurvive, it will lose a lot; but Bosnian Muslims may end up even worse\noff.  However, their position now is so horrible that perhaps they do not\nsee it getting any worse.  The key point is: do they still have any hope left?\nIf not, then all bets are off.\n\nMr. Stojanovic is clearly very, very happy about this.  I'm deeply hurt.\nThis is not about some \"image\" but about survival of a concept of a\npartnership which I believe is natural and essential for both Croats\nand Muslims.  \n\nSigh...\nJosip\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

PST\n\t     \n\t     \n\t     Folks, we're about to start the BACKGROUND BRIEFING \non the aid package.\n\n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Good morning.  The \nPresident -- President Clinton and President Yeltsin agreed \nyesterday on a series of American initiatives to support economic \nand political reform in Russia, and it's valued at $1.6 billion.  \n\n\t     Before taking your questions and running through the \nbasic outlines of this package, I want to make a few points.  \nFirst, this is the maximum that the Clinton administration can do \nwith available funds to support Russian reform.  All of the funds \nhave been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  There is \nno need for the administration to go back to the Congress to fund \nany of these programs.  All our Fiscal Year '93 funds currently \nare available, so in effect, all of these programs can begin \ntomorrow.\n\t     \n\t     The second point is that this package is designed to \nsupport Russian reformers.  All of the initiatives in the package \nare directed at reformers and for their benefit, and all have \nbeen worked out with prior consultation with the Russian \ngovernment.\n\t     \n\t     Third, the President is determined that we will \ndeliver on these commitments this year.  The package is designed \nto maximize our ability to support reform.  In designing it we \nwanted to avoid making commitments that we could not meet, and we \nfeel very confident that we can meet all of these commitments in \nfront of you.\n\t     \n\t     Fourth, I'd like to note the special importance of \ntrade and investment.  I think it's fair to say that Russia's \ncapital and technology needs throughout the next decade extend \nwell into the hundreds of billions of dollars.  No collection of \ngovernments can meet those needs; only the private sector can do \nso.  And so the President and President Yeltsin agreed to make \ntrade and investment a major priority in the relationship.  \n\t     \n\t     They also agreed that there would be a new joint \ncommission on energy and space formed, headed on the U.S. side by \nVice President Gore; on the Russian side by Prime Minister \nChernomyrdin.  And the goal of this effort is to break through \nthe barriers to trade and investment on both sides and to promote \na vastly expanded relationship.\n\t     \n\t     If it would be helpful I'd be prepared to run down \nthe first page, which is a summary of U.S. assistance, and just \ngive you some general background on what these programs are.  \nI'll do it quickly and then I'll be glad to take questions.\n\t     \n\t     The first group of initiatives are humanitarian food \nand medical assistance.  This is part of our effort which has \nbeen underway for several years to provide basic humanitarian \ngrant food assistance so that the Russian government can assure \nthere's at least a minimal amount of bread on the shelves in the \nmajor cities.  That's $194 million in grant -- that is from Food \nfor Progress, the grant portion of Food for Progress.  We'll also \nbe continuing our grant assistance in medicines and \npharmaceutical supplies, and that's $30 million.\n\t     \n\t     The second item is concessional food sales.  As you \nknow, the United States has had a long-term grain relationship \nwith Russia.  It's important to us and it's important to Russia \nthat we continue that relationship.  The President has chosen the \nFood for Progress program which is a concessional loan program.  \nThe value over the next seven months is $700 million.  These are \nconcessional terms.  The exact terms have not been worked out, \nbut I think it's fair to say there will be a grace period on \nprincipal of six or seven years, and concessional rates \nthereafter for the life of the deal.\n\t     \n\t     The third program is a collection of private sector \nsupport.  We think this is one of the most important things we're \ngoing to do.  Privatization and the creation of small businesses \nis the number one priority of the reform government in Moscow.  \nAnd so the President has decided to create a Russian-American \nenterprise fund capitalized this year at $50 million.  And the \ngoal of this fund is to make direct loans to small businesses in \nRussia, to take equity positions in those businesses.  \n\t     \n\t     The President has also decided to create a \nprivatization fund which would work directly with the Russian \ngovernment in its priority objective of trying to convert state \nenterprises from a state-owned basis to a private basis.  He has \nalso agreed -- the President has also agreed to establish a \nEurasia foundation.  This would be a private foundation led by \nprominent Americans to fund democratization projects in Russia.\n\t     \n\t     The fourth grouping you see there in the summary \npage is democratization itself.  I think it's fair to say that \nthis administration has given a new impetus to the goal of \npursuing democratization in Russia.  You see that we have a total \nof $48 million in programs, various programs.  The detailed \ntables give an indication of some of the programs that we're \nlaunching.  \n\t     \n\t     The President is also calling for the development of \na democracy corps, which will be an overarching umbrella group to \ntry to incorporate all of the disparate private and public \nefforts now underway from the United States to support reform in \nRussia.\n\t     \n\t     The fifth program you see is Russian office of \nresettlement.  This is a new initiative created and \nconceptualized by this administration.  This is a demonstration \nproject.  What we'd like to do is work with the Russian military \nto help resettle Russian officers returning from the Baltic \nstates and other parts of the former Soviet Union.  We want to \nmake sure that we work out the best way to do that, whether it's \nwith Russian labor and Russian materials or using prefab American \nconstruction.  And so we've decided to fund on a demonstration \nbasis the construction of 450 housing units.  We'll be working \nvery closely with the Russian military on this.  And I would say \nthat we have a long-term commitment to this project.  \n\t     \n\t     The sixth area is energy in the environment.  They \nare two issues that the President feels strongly about.  Our \ninitial efforts will be feasibility studies to look into the \npossibility of enhancing their energy production, both oil and \ngas; and equally important trying to cut down on the leakages in \nthe oil and gas pipeline systems, which cause so much \nenvironmental damage.\n\t     \n\t     I've talked a little bit about trade and investment, \nabout the new group being created that the Vice President will \nchair on our side.  Secretary Ron Brown will also be cochairing \nwith Deputy Prime Minister Shohkin, a business development \ncommittee, which will work in all other sectors of the economy, \nto break down the many barriers that currently exist and impede \ntrade and investment.  We are also going to appoint a full-time \ninvestment ombudsman in the American government to work on this \nproblem full-time.  \n\t     \n\t     And the point I'd like to make here is, trade and \ninvestment in the 1990s is every bit as important, to draw an \nanalogy, as arms reductions was in the '70s and '80s.  And we \njust thought that in looking at this we needed to make a \ncommitment within our own government to have people work on it -- \nsenior people on a full-time basis, because it is terribly \nimportant.\n\t     \n\t     You'll notice that the United States is going to \nsupport Russia's membership in the GATT.  Russia has had observer \nstatus.  Russia has requested our support and, in fact, requested \nour advice in becoming a member of the GATT.  We think that the \nlong-term goal of drawing Russia into the global economy is \nparamount, a very important goal.  And that is why we are \nsupporting the membership in the GATT.  We are also supporting \ntheir access to GSP, the Generalized System of Preferences.  \n\t     \n\t     You'll note that Ex-Im has extended $82 million in \ncredit for a caterpillar deal in Siberia, that OPIC has extended \n$150 million in credits and loan guarantees for a Conoco oil \nproject.  I'd like to emphasize that we are very close to an \nagreement between Russia and the United States for a $2-billion \nframework facility through the Ex-Im Bank that would finance \nRussian purchases of American oil and gas equipment and services. \nWe think this is a very important development.  We think we'll \nget there by April 14th, which is the opening day of the Tokyo \nconference, the G-7 conference.\n\t     \n\t     Before I take any further questions, I'd like to \ndefer to my colleague, who will review the security assistance \nobjectives with you.\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Our major \nunfinished agenda with the Russians and with their counterparts \nin Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus is in the area of the safe and \nsecure dismantlement of the nuclear arsenals on their territory \nunder the terms of the START I and START II agreements.   \nRecently we completed in Moscow three, I think, very important \nagreements that devote a significant chunk of Nunn-Lugar funding \nto three important programs.  The first is the program of $130 \nmillion for the strategic nuclear delivery vehicle dismantlement \nprogram.  That is for submarines, for ICBM dismantlement and for \nbomber dismantlement -- $130 million.\n\t     \n\t     The second is a $75 million tranche of funding for \nthe construction of a facility to store nuclear materials removed \nfrom the warheads as they are dismantled.  This will essentially \ncontribute to the overall design and the early phases of the \nconstruction of that storage facility.  \n\t     \n\t     And finally, a $10-million tranche of money to help \nin the establishment of a monitoring system for the nuclear \nmaterials as they are withdrawn from the weapons system.  So we \nadd that $215-million total to the extant Nunn-Lugar assistance \nwhich has been flowing -- about $150 million for some overall \nsafety improvements for various kinds of equipment and safety \nmeasures that we have been working out with the Russians over the \nlast couple of years.  \n\t     \n\t     So this is an area where we will be going a lot more \nwork with not only the Russians but with the Ukrainians, Kazhaks, \nand Belarussians.  Belarus, for example, has just, in the last \ncouple of weeks, received up to $65 million in FY'93 funds for \nsafety, security and dismantlement programs on Belarussian \nterritory.  And this was in the wake of their ratification of \nSTART I, an agreement to accede to NPT. \n\t     \n\t     So we are working very hard with all the parties to \nthe Lisbon protocols, and will continue to work very hard with \nthem.  And I look upon these three recent agreements with Russia \nas a very important step in that process.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The OPIC funds to -- is that for the field in \nKazhakstan -- and Conoco already signed this deal with \nKazhakstan.  Why do you feel now it is necessary -- if it's the \nsame one, why do you feel it's necessary?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  It's not the same \ndeal.  Chevron signed a deal with Kazhakstan, the Tenges oil \nfield.  This is a new investment project.  It's a polar lights \noil development and renovation project, and it's being announced \ntoday.  So it's completely new.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Can you tell us more about what's involved?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yes.  Conoco, like \nother American oil companies has been searching for ways to do \ntwo things.  One, to prospect for new oil in Siberia, west \nSiberia; and two, to try to get into the business of renovating \noil wells and renovating pipelines, both oil and gas, in Russia.  \nThe objective here, obviously, is to take advantage of the \nnatural resources in Russia, increase energy production, which \nwill, in turn, increase hard currency revenues, which is what \nRussia needs.\n\t     \n\t     So we think this deal is very, very good development \nfor Russia.  The Russians do as well, and it's good for an \nAmerican company.  And the American government has played a \nleading role in pulling this together through the credit facility \nin OPIC and through the loan guarantee.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  So it's to search and also to renovate fields \nthat are already there?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  On that point, should other American companies \nexpect to get administration support for such deals, or should \nthey now go to the Ex-Im and try to get the money out of the $2 \nbillion?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as you know, \nEx-Im is part of the U.S. government and various parts of the \nU.S. government have been pushing, including the State Department \nand the White House for this deal to be consummated.  And we \nthink it will.  And if we arrive at this agreement by April 14th, \nthere will be $2 billion in financing available for American \ncompanies to sell their equipment and sell their services.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  That should take up all of the rest of the \ndeals and their won't be -- and their will or there won't be \nsupport for OPIC sort of deals such as this Conoco?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a \ntremendous amount of interest on the part of American oil and gas \ncompanies to invest in Russia.  We think that the Ex-Im oil and \ngas facility, the $2-billion facility, once it is concluded, will \nsoak up a lot of that interest.  But I think the interest may \neven extend beyond that.  And if so, the government will respond.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What's the current year budget costs of that \n$2-billion agreement should it go forward?  And is there any \ncurrent year budget costs --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I'll have to refer \nyou to Ex-Im for that.  I don't know the details of that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The concessional food sales -- is there any \ncurrent year costs to that, or is it delayed until the years in \nwhich the payments are due?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The concessional \nfood sales are from Food for Progress, which is a USDA program.  \nUSDA has the funds, we don't need to go back to the Congress to \nexpend those funds.  There will be a hit in the budget.  I'd \nrefer you to USDA and OMB for the details on that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Can you talk about the Democracy Corps?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     and the private sector -- how many folks are \ngoing to be involved in that?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Why don't I start \nwith the Democracy Corps first.  I think the administration felt \ncoming into office that there were literally thousands of \norganization, private organizations in the United States that in \none way or another were working at the goal of trying to achieve \ndemocratization in Russia, helping on a farmer-to-farmer basis.  \nAnd there were literally 10 or 15 U.S. government agencies that \nhad a variety of programs in this area.  And so the \nadministration felt -- the President felt it was important to try \nto draw all of these initiatives together under one group to give \nsome coherence to the efforts and to give some impetus to the \nefforts.  And so this is a presidential initiative.\n\t     \n\t     It will be headed by Ambassador Tom Simons who will \nsoon take up his duties as the coordinator for U.S. assistance in \nthe former Soviet Union.  And we're very hopeful that we might \nuse this Democracy Corps not only to draw upon the resources of \nour own government, but the resources of the American private \nsector and schools and communities across the nation.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     any kind of commitment yet, any kind of word \nyet on FY'94, and any new money that needs to be appropriated \nbesides the $300 million the President talked about?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The administration \nis requesting additional funds in FY'94 of $700 million.  What \nthe President has done this weekend is to consult really \nintensively yesterday with President Yeltsin about additional \nmeasures the United States could take in some of these areas to \nsupport reform.  He'll be consulting with the Congress.  When he \nreturns to Washington, he'll be consulting also with the other \nally governments, and we'll make a decision at that time.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Two questions about the $700 billion \nagricultural money.  First of all, I thought it was the sort of \nconsensus that what Russia did not need was more loans for food.  \nSo why did you decide to do it that way?  Secondly, could you \nexplain -- agriculture has been stopped from making further loans \nfor food because of Russia's inability to pay.  How does this fit \ninto that situation?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As you know, the \nUnited States for a long time has been a major supplier of grains \nand food commodities, agricultural products to Russia.  I think \nbetween 1991 and '92 we had extended -- a little bit of history \nhere -- about $5.5 billion in credits, credit guarantees, through \nthe Commodity Credit Corporation.  That was the principal vehicle \nto ensure the sale of American grain products.  On December 1 of \nlast year, '92, the Russian government stopped its payments on \nthat program.  They are now in arrears to us on that program, and \ntherefore, by law, the United States cannot continue that \nprogram.  And so the President, working with Secretary Espy and \nother officials in the Cabinet, looked for other ways that we \ncould promote American grain sales.  \n\t     \n\t     And I think we have two ways to do that.  We've \nannounced today $194 million in grant food assistance through the \nFood for Progress program.  But we do not have sufficient \nauthority to spend $700 million in grant food, and so we looked \nfor a concessional loan program.  \n\t     \n\t     I think everybody agrees that Russia -- that a \nshort-term loan program for Russia would not make sense now, but \na long-term concessional loan program would.  And that is what \nthis program is.  It will provide, once the final details are \nworked out, for a six to seven-year grace period on payments of \nprincipal.  And then from years seven through 15, which is the \nlife of the deal, it will provide for concessional rates of \ninterest -- generally around three to four percent.  And so we \nbelieve and the Russian government believes this is a good deal \nfor them because it will avoid the imperative of early payments \nand put them into the out years, but it will also continue this \nvery important grain relationship, which is important for them, \nand it's important for the American farm community.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I gather from what you say that this could make \nit explicit -- the Russians' failure to pay the interest on ECC \nloan does not in any way affect this kind of loan going through, \nis that right? \n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Let me be explicit \nabout that.  We are prevented under the law to from continuing  \nthe Commodity Credit Corporation short-term credit program \nbecause of Russia's arrearages to the United States.  All of you \nknow about those arrearages.  They total about, I think, around \n$640 million.  USDA can give you an exact figure.  So having \ntaken that into consideration and wanting to preserve American \nmarket share and a long-term grain relationship, wanting to \nrespond to a specific request from the Russian government for \nmajor food assistance, knowing that we couldn't take it from the \ngrant programs because we don't have sufficient authority there, \nwe looked at Food for Progress, which is a program we've used to \ngreat effect in other parts of the world.  And we consulted with \nthe Russian government and arrived at this solution.  \n\t     \n\t     I think the Russians are pleased because it provides \nthem with the food, but also gives them a little bit of relief on \nthe short-term payments.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Where do those funds actually come from?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  They come from the \nFood for Progress program, which is a program under USDA's \nauthority.  USDA has the authority to spend these funds.  We do \nnot need to go back to the Congress for these funds.  And I want \nto make that general point again:  Everything in this package, \nthe $1.6 billion package, comprises funds that have already been \nallocated and appropriated by the Congress.  The administration \ncan begin to spend these monies tomorrow.  And it's very \nimportant in our eyes that we expend all the funds this year, \nthat we meet these commitments.  And we are confident we'll be \nable to do so.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  How did you arrive at the figure of $700 \nmillion -- does that max out that program, or did you actually \nhave a range from 0 to --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a reason \nfor it.  The reason was that the Russian government told us \nthat's about the amount of grain that they needed between now and \nharvest time.  And so the idea is that we would begin the \nshipments probably $100 million per month from now until the \nharvest in the autumn, at which time Russia won't require the \nsame level of food imports from the West.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I would imagine there's going to be some \nconsiderable envy and jealousy on the part of some of the other \nrepublics because of the size and the scope of this with Russia.  \nHave you given any consideration to advancing negotiations for \nthe same kinds of projects with the Ukraine, with Georgia , with \nsome of the other republics?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, we're very \nconscience of the fact that we also have an interest in extending \nAmerican support to the 11 other countries of the former Soviet \nUnion.  We have told ourselves, and we have planned that in the \narea of technical assistance, the grant technical assistance that \nyou see, roughly 50 percent of the funding will go to Russia and \nroughly 50 percent to the other countries. \n\t     \n\t     In the area of food sales, we have been active with \nUkraine, in grant food assistance with Georgia and Armenia.  We \nwill continue that.  And I think it's fair to say that after this \nsummit we will go back and look at all of our programs with the \nother countries to ensure that they are adequate and they are \nproductive and they're hard-hitting.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Has anything happened at the summit to lead \nAmerican energy companies and other companies to believe that \nRussia is going to be more user-friendly toward them in terms of \ntaxing, legalities, bureaucracy?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, one of our \nprimary objectives coming into this summit was to highlight,  not \nonly the economic agenda, but also trade and investment.  And I'd \nlike to refer to the point I made at the beginning.  We're \nconvinced in talking about this problem -- the problem of how to \nsupport Russia long-term -- we're convinced that no collection of \nWestern governments have the financial resources over the next \ndecade to fuel the continuation of reform, that only the private \nsector can do that.  \n\t     \n\t     We look at our own society and we see tremendous \ncapability in resources in the oil and gas sector.  It is a very \ngood match with what the Russians need now, which is financial \ninvestment in the existing oil and gas wells and pipeline and new \ntechnology and new capital to finance new production.  \n\t     \n\t     That's what the Russian government has told us it \nwants to do, and so that's why we have made such a major emphasis \non it.  That's why trade and investment was a prominent issue on \nthe first day of these talks, and in fact, figured prominently \nlast night in the meeting between President Yeltsin and President \nClinton.  And we're hoping that together we might send a strong \nsignal to the American business community that we support their \nefforts to invest in Russia, that the United States, through Ex-\nIm and OPEC and the Department of Commerce, will be there to \nsupport them.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  My question is, is Yeltsin in any position to \ndeliver on making Russia a more --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We think he is.  I \nwould note that President Yeltsin's Prime Minister, Mr. \nChernomyrdin, worked for 30 years in the Russian oil and gas \nsector.  He will now chair a high-level commission with the Vice \nPresident, Vice President Gore, to try to break through the \nbarriers that currently exist to Western investment in the oil \nand gas sector.  We believe we have a commitment to make that \ncommittee an important committee.  And we're looking forward to \nthe work.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What type of mechanism is already in place to \nadminister the private sector portion of the program?  And will \nthe U.S. be directly involved in the tail end of distribution of \nthe actual funds or is the money simply turned over to the \nRussian government for distribution at their will?\n\t     \t    \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Are you talking \nabout the variety of programs listed here?  It depends on the \nprogram itself.  In most cases, though, we are either working \nthrough American PBOs or American government agencies to ensure \nthat the money obviously is well spent, that the money gets to \nthe intended source.  That's an obligation we have to the \nCongress to ensure the money is well spent and that we can \naccount for the money.  We have done that in the last couple of \nmonths intensively and we will continue to do it for each of \nthese programs.\n\t     \n\t     But they are all quite different.  For instance, in \nthe area of grant food and medical assistance, for grant food it \nis carried out through USDA and USDA accounts for the delivery of \nthe food.  For grant medical assistance, we've been working \nthrough Project Hope which is a private organization.  For the \nhousing -- for instance, the resettlement of Russian officers, \nwe'll be working with a group of American PBOs.  On some of the \ndemocratization projects, we're working directly with Russian \nprivate individuals and private foundations.  We're working with \njournalists in Russia on a media project that you may have \nnoticed.\n\t     \n\t     So we literally have here 30 to 40 different \nactivities under all these rubrics and they're all going to be \ncarried out in slightly different ways.  Some directly with the \nRussian government, some with Russian citizens.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The Jackson-Vanik restrictions that remain and \non the COCOM restrictions that remain, can you tell us what the \nPresident has to do on that?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as George \nnoted yesterday, President Yeltsin raised these as irritants in \nthe relationship.  The President has noted that.  I think it's \nfair to say we will go back now in our own government when we \nreturn to Washington and look at both of these questions, and \nwe'll get back to the Russian government.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You were not prepared for these questions when \nyou got here?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We were prepared \nfor these questions.  We've looked at them.  But we're not \nprepared to make a quick decision this weekend.  They require --\nlet me just explain, particularly on Jackson-Vanik.  They require \nconsultation with the Congress.  They require consultation with \nthe American Jewish community.  And we're very sensitive to those \nconcerns.  And so we'll want to go back and talk to them before \nwe take any action.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is this package designed so that you will not \nhave to go to Congress for anything at this point?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As I said at the \nbeginning, the advantage of this particular package is that all \nthe funds have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  \nSo the administration will not have to go back to the Congress to \nseek any additional authority to fund any of these efforts.  In \neffect, they can all begin tomorrow, and I know that many of the \nagencies responsible for these projects will begin tomorrow.  And \nthat's the advantage of this particular initiative.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  If this, as the President says, is a long-term, \nlong-haul thing, and members of Congress are at this moment \nheading for Moscow, why aren't you talking about going to \nCongress and suggesting to the President of Russia that you are \nprepared to go to Congress for various things?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think we've been \nclear about that.  The President is discussing this weekend with \nPresident Yeltsin some additional ideas that we have for American \nfunding of additional projects, and ideas that he has.  We have a \nmajor congressional delegation that left last night, headed by \nRepresentative Gephardt and we'll want to consult with that \ndelegation and other members of Congress before doing anything.  \nAnd we'll also want to consult with our allies.  So that's where \nit stands now.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  We've been told repeatedly that a number of \nthese items represent different or new ways of spending the money \nalready appropriated.  Could you just tick off which of these \nitems represents reprogramming or at least spending money in ways \nthat it was not previously set to be?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that we've \nsaid that these are all projects that either Congress had \nallocated money for through the Freedom Support Act; there were \nsome funds that were left over from FY'92.  And this \nadministration took office and had some new ideas about how the \nfunds might be expended.\n\t     \n\t     We didn't use just the Freedom Support Act funds or \nthe FY'92 funds.  We went into some of the agency allocations --\nEx-Im, OPIC, and USDA -- and tried to look for creative ways to \nfurther our programs.\n\t     \n\t     And example of that is the Food for Progress \nconcessional loans.  We had hit a brick wall with another type of \nfunding through USDA.  We could not go forward legally, and so we \nlooked for a more creative way to ensure continued American \nmarket share and ensure continued grain sales, and we think we \nfound it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Where, for example, are you getting the money \nfor this Russian officer resettlement --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's from the \nFreedom Support Act funds.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  In other words, all of the money is being \ndirectly spent in new ways, so to speak --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Most of the grant \nprojects that you see -- if you look at the general chart, the \nsecond chart, it's broken down into grant and credits.  And if \nyou look under grants, the technical cooperation projects that \ntotal $281.9 million -- that is almost all Freedom Support Act \nfunding.  A little bit of it is leftover funds from fiscal year \n'92.  The Nunn-Lugar funds, of course, you know about the \nlegislative history of those funds.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     cooperation --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  From FY '92?  I \ndon't have the exact figure.  It was not a considerable figure.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Could you tell us please, has anything happened \nhere this weekend that will break the log jam between Ukraine and \nRussia over START -- for START I and II as a result of what's \nhappened here --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Both presidents, \nPresident Yeltsin and President Clinton, will be discussing this \nissue this morning.  In fact, we haven't yet gotten to security \nand arms control related issues.  That will be this morning's \nsession.  I know that President Clinton will be very strongly \nreinforcing that this is a top priority for us.  We've been \ntalking to the Russians and the Ukrainians over the last couple \nof weeks about ways that we might help to facilitate the \ndiscussions between them.  Up to this point, this has been a very \nimportant negotiation that's been going on essentially between \nMoscow and Kiev.  And we are at the point now of essentially \ndiscussing with them if there are ways that we could contribute \nto this discussion, help to move things forward essentially.  \n\t     \n\t     But in terms of what is coming out of this weekend, \nI don't yet know.  In a couple hours we'll know.\n\t     \n\t     Q?\t    Just a follow-up on the financing here.  Is \nany of this robbing Peter to pay Boris -- since it's all current \nyear appropriations, have you taken it from anyplace that's been \nearmarked and put it into this fund?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There are smoke and \nmirrors here, and I think it's an important point to note.  We \ncould have given you a page of assistance numbers that included \nout-year funding.  We're going to make a long-term commitment to \nmany of these projects -- for instance, the enterprise funds, the \nprivatization effort, the housing effort.  And we've already \ntalked to the Russians about our long-term commitment.  \n\t     \n\t     We could have put in really big numbers and this \ncould have been a bigger package, but we wanted to make a point:  \nThis package is FY '93.  It's funds that we have.  And we're \ngoing to do what we say we're going to do.  And the President \nfeels very strongly about that.  In the past there is a legacy \nthat the western governments, the combination of governments, put \nup large budget figures and for any number of reasons we're not \nable to meet them, we're determined, and the President is \ndetermined, to carry out every single program in this package.  \nAnd we'll do it.  \n\t     \n\t     But we do have a longer-term commitment, and that's \npart of the discussions on economics this weekend.  We're looking \nfor Russian ideas on what it is we can do to most effectively \nsupport reform.  And we've told them that we do have a commitment \non some of these programs beyond this fiscal year.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     taken it way from any --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, we haven't.  \nOkay, the question is, have we reprogrammed any of these funds; \nso have we taken it from other countries to pay for programs in \nRussia?  The answer is no, we have not done so.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  In terms of funding, there is no available \nmonies left -- and you simply find a creative way to find money \nsomewhere else.  Doesn't that, in fact, support the -- theory?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Not at all.  I \ndon't think it does.  That's a particular example, and the \nexample is grain sales.  The Commodity Credit Corporation credit \nguarantee program was short-term loans that Russia had to pay \nback within 12 to 15 months.  You all know about Russia's debt \nproblem, and Russia was unable to meet those commitments.  So we \nlooked for a way to do two things:  to meet Russia's requirement \nfor grain.  They're a net grain importer on a massive scale, and \nalso meet our objective of making sure that the American farmers \nhave a chance to sell their products to Russia.  And we simply \nlook for another way to finance that.  And we have legislative \nauthority to do it.  This program has been successful in other \nareas.  We had not tried it before in the former Soviet Union, \nbut we thought we should now.\n\t     \t  \n\t     Q\t  Isn't this really the Bush-Clinton aid package \nfor Russia, since these funds were really first derived by \ninitiatives put forward by President Bush?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I don't think \nthat's a fair characterization.  A lot of these funds were \nappropriated by the U.S. Congress is 1991, in 1992.  This \nadministration took office and inherited some obligations that \nthe Bush administration had made.  But we had a long six to seven \nweek review of this program.  We decided to meet the commitments \nthat had been made by the previous administration.  \n\t     \n\t     But we have gone well beyond them in funding the \nenterprise fund, which was just an idea, but the idea had not \nbeen filled out with a program.  There was no number attached to \nit.  In grouping together some projects and trying to make them \ninto a coherent whole in the privatization effort, I would say, \nis another Clinton initiative.  \n\t     \n\t     Further, we listened to the Russian government and \nlistened to the Russian military who told us that the \nresettlement of their officers was important to them for \npolitical and economic and social reasons.  And President Clinton \nhas responded to that.  And we are making a long-term commitment \nthat beyond this demonstration project we're going to figure out \na way to do much more in trying to settle those officers.  \n\t     \n\t     I would also say that the President has given \nimpetus to all of us in the agencies to think much more broadly \nabout what it is we can do on democratization, because there we \nhave some experience and some comparative advantage that lends \nitself to the Russian experience.  And in calling for the \ncreation of a democracy corps, which is another new initiative, \nwe're hopeful that we can take the resources of the private \nsector as well as the American government, to achieve that \nobjective.  \n\t     \n\t     So I would not characterize it that way at all.  And \nas most of you know, I am a career civil servant.  I was in the \nlast administration.  I'm very familiar with what the last \nadministration did.  And I would characterize this as a Clinton \nassistance package for Russia.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  There's been a lot of criticism that aid in the \npast has not gotten to the people.  Is there anything in this \noutside of the ombudsman, that will guarantee that this money \nwill not just disappear because it's being administered by the \nRussian government?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that -- I \nknow that the President and other senior officials of our \ngovernment are concerned that American money be spent wisely and \nthat it get to the source that it's intended -- for which it's \nintended.  And so we're going to take great care -- AID and the \nState Department will take great care in making sure that the \nfunds are expended properly and that they're reaching their \nsource.\n\t     \n\t     I would not that this package is not simply a \npackage of support solely to the Russian government.  Some of \nthese projects, especially in democratization and exchanges, are \ngoing to be worked out directly with Russian private individuals, \nwith businesses.  The private enterprise support is another \nexample of that.\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If I could just add \na word on this point with regard to the SSD-related programs, one \narea that we've been looking at very, very closely is \nconsideration of actually using Russian firms in subcontracting \nfor these kinds of programs.  They would be working very closely, \nof course, with the American firms, who would be the prime \ncontractors.  But this is a fine example, I think, of a more --of \na imaginative and flexible approach toward getting some of that \nfunding down to the grassroots level, down to the ground in \nRussia; but at the same time ensuring that it is spent \nefficiently and for the purposes for which it was intended.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  When would the democracy corps start?  Exactly \nwhen do you see this happening?  How would get it off the ground?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the President \nis today calling for the creation of a democracy corps.  I think \nit's fair to say that we're going to work out its framework over \nthe next couple of weeks.  Ambassador Simons takes up his duties \non May 1st.  But in effect we've already started, because over \nthe last couple of weeks the administration has begun to reach \nout to people in the private sector who have come to us asking us \nto help facilitate their activities in Russia.  And we've said \nthat we will be helpful.  We've also tried to kind of coordinate \nin a much more effective way the activities of our own \ngovernment.  We do have 10 or 15 agencies that are active in \nRussia in one way or another.  We think it makes sense to draw \nthem together and to focus their efforts.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Excuse me.  How much of this $1.6 billion will \nactually be spent in the United States by American made goods?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't have any \nfigures for you now, but perhaps we could try to work something \nup in the next couple of days on that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  This figure is larger than the figure that has \nbeen in the press -- did this program grow yesterday as a result \nof the discussions, or have we just been that far off the mark?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I think --\nunfortunately the press has been a little bit off the mark, and \nI'm sorry to say that.  No, this package -- President Clinton put \nus to work about seven weeks ago on this package.  And he was \nbriefed intensively on this.  He contributed a lot of the \nintellectual leadership in this package.  He contributed a lot of \nthe ideas in the package.  And I think it's fair to say that we \nhad this rough package worked out about two weeks ago.  We have \nbeen refining it ever since.  We spent a couple of days last week \ngoing over it with the Russian government, both the embassy in \nWashington and the government in Moscow through our own embassy.  \nAnd so it's been evolving.  But this particular package has been \ntogether for about two weeks.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Where is Yeltsin's input into this then?  There \nwas so much talk before about the President wanted to get \nYeltsin's views about specifically what was needed and so forth.  \nIs that in the out years?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, it's both.  \nPresident Yeltsin has on several occasions told us, for instance, \nthat support for the creation of private businesses is important \nto him; that the resettlement of Russian military officers is \nimportant; and that first and foremost the effort to privatize \nthe state industries is important to them.  \n\t     \n\t     And so what we did was to try to make those the \ncenterpiece of our technical assistance part o the package.  We \nlistened to him.  On the privatization effort, we have been \nworking with the Russian government for months on this trying to \nwork out all the details.  So the Russian government on most of \nthese programs was involved every step of the way.  \n\t     \n\t     But let me get at the other part of your question.  \nThe President is also using this weekend to talk about a broader \nset of initiatives that we might undertake.  And we're looking \nfor his ideas.  The President has brought his own ideas to the \ntable -- for instance, on energy and the environment and in \nhousing.  But we're looking for Russian ideas not.  We need to \nconsult with the Congress; and we need to consult with the other \nallied governments that are also active.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  There's essentially nothing that happened in \nthe last day and a half that measurably altered the package that \nyou came in with?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  This particular \npackage, as I said, was worked out and was ready about two weeks \nago.  We have since then consulted with the Russian government on \nthe final stages of its development, and so this weekend we've \nprimarily talked about future, about what more the United States \nand other Western countries can do to support reform in Russia, \nwhich is our base objective here.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I noticed that you -- that money appropriated \nto train bankers and businessmen and officers.  Can you tell me \nwhat about job training for workers who are displaced by \nprivatization?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  You're right; we \nhave a program to train Russian -- young Russians in banking and \nfinancial services in the United States.  Part of the housing \ninitiative, it's not just to build housing units, it's to retrain \nRussian officers who are retiring into other professions.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     money for job training for workers whose \njobs are disappearing because of privatization --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We have not yet \nallocated any money for that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Why not?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     of the $6 million is going to build 450 \nhousing units.  Isn't that a lot of money per unit given what the \nWestern dollar will buy in the former Soviet Union?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If you want to do \nhousing the right way, it's not just the building the framework \nof a house, you've got to think about all the utilities.  You've \ngot to think about the purchase of land.  You've got to think \nabout sewage and gas and electricity and so forth.  And it's also \nretraining.  It's not enough to put retired -- an officer coming \nout of -- Riga or Tallin or Vilnius in a house in western Russia.  \nWe think we have an obligation to try to retrain those officers \nas well.  This is responding to a request from the Russian \ngovernment.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     of the $6 million will go to retrain --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Are you talking about apartment buildings or \nsingle --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We're talking about \nsingle, individual dwellings.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You're saying that only 450 families will be \nserved by this?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  What I want to -- I \nthought I pointed out earlier, this is a demonstration project.  \nWhat we didn't want to do -- given the experience that the \nGermans and the Turks and the Italians have had in building \nhousing in western Russian, we did not want to leap into it with \na huge amount of money.  What we want to do is work over the next \ncouple of months and try to figure out with American \norganizations in the private sector the best way to get this job \ndone.  \n\t     \n\t     I noted that we have a long-term commitment to that.  \nAnd so I would expect that we would put a lot more money into \nthis in the future .  But we want to do it wisely; we want to \nspend the money wisely.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What is it about this program that convinces \nyou that it will protect Russia's reforms and that Russia will be \nin a position to may back the money they're supposed to pay back, \nespecially considering their other debt problem?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, look, I think \nit's important to note that the United States on its own does not \nhave the capability to fuel a continuation of Russian reform.  \nIt's got to be a collective Western effort, and we're looking to \nour allies to do more as well.  But beyond that, it's really what \nthe Russians do that is going to decide the fate of reform.  We \ncan simply play a role, and we feel we have an obligation to do \nso, which is consistent with our national interests.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did the President say that the value of the \nU.S. contribution was that it would create security and \nprosperity for the United States?  So what is it about this \nprogram that does this?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think you have to \ngo back to the fundamental objective of our policy toward Russia, \nand that is we want to do everything we can to support the \ncontinuation of reform.  We are convinced that if reformers stay \nin power, then we'll be able to continue the drawdown of nuclear \nforces, foreign policy cooperation and economic interaction, \nwhich are the three benefits to the United States from reform in \nRussia.  So it's not a simple question.  You can't just say that \nthis program is the answer.  It's a long-term question and we \nhave to make a long-term commitment to it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And then on the question of Russia's ability to \nrepay, what convinces you they'll be able to pay seven to 15 \nyears from now?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the Russian \ngovernment has made a commitment to repay, and what we're hoping \nis that if reform continues, and if they can continue to improve \ntheir oil and gas sector and earn additional hard currency \nrevenues, that Russia will be in a position six or seven years \nfrom now to pay back those loans.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     substantial government-to-government loan \nwe've ever gotten into with the Russians?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't want to \nanswer authoritatively on that.  I don't go back 20 or 30 years \non this.  But in the last four or five years, yes it is, because \nthe previous way that we financed grain exports was really to \njust ensure private bank loans.  This is a different type of \neffort.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     government loans in any other sector that \nyou recall?  I know it wasn't done in --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think it's fair \nto say this is a new and unique effort.\n\n                               END10:25 A.M. PDT\n"

Other than government land, saved for posterity and the eco-system\nas well as government function, the remaining land is owned by a smaller\npercentage of the people than ever before. The game of capitalism is almost\nwon. The game has only to be declared over and we will have to take matters\ninto our own hands and redistribute it again fairly, or else be enslaved in\nreturn for a place to live. Here in central California, already, fewer than\n30% own all the property and 5% of them own 90% of it. That's twice what it\nwas twenty years ago. Rents are so high that you pay 60% of your income for\nrent. If you just have a McJob, all you can afford is one room, if that.\nSome 30% of minimum wage workers are homeless. Unless you both have degrees\nin technical fields and are working in them, (in the midst of 30%\nunemployment in high tech jobs!), you will never own anything but a used\ncar if you choose to have more than one child!!! And everywhere else you\ncould afford there are no jobs. The only way to get there is to save and\nnot consume any more than you have to, clothing used, food poor. No movies,\nno entertainment,, ect. for about five to seven years, and then, if you've\nsaved $20,000, if you can get together that much, and that's ignoring your\nkids and working two jobs, then you can buy a home in Arkansas or Missouri\noutright and live somewhere where they flood every other year! That's an\nexaggeration if you pay close attention to the flood lines on other\npeople's houses and find a sturdy hill, then you can buy one up there! Also\nbuy a rowboat. Missouri's not so bad, if you like the sensation of sleeping\nin a sweatbox in summer and your car freezing solid in winter. They really\ndo put those heaters into the dipstick hole to keep them warm enough to\nstart with ether!:) Shit, kill the rich and redistribute the livable\nproperty.

Extra is kept for\nthe future. You get to stay where you are without paying rent. Land that\nsupports others becomes property of the state. Farmers are welcome to plant\ncrops that people need according to demand and ability and soil quality. If\nyou want to grow sourgum because you always did, and you aren't doing a\ngood job, then we let another farmer grow sorghum, and you grow something\nelse. When people die the land they were entitled to use goes into the\npublic holdings. No one can sell land, but they can trade places with\nanybody. No one can lease land. The government will locally distribute the\nuse of the land not used for residences. Residences that are insufficient\nto the families living there can be traded to the public for a larger house\nand yard according to need and availability. The local land council who vow\nto live on their land till death to avoid profit ties will decide fairness\nsubject to review by the state and federal land councils. It will cost no\nmore than any fucking thing costs now with fucking assed rent going down a\ndeep dark hole to the owners! Anyone can submit a request for a larger\nhouse or land to start a business on, depending on a valid business plan\nand community needs. Heavy equipment is subject to seizure for the public\ngood or as needed. Heavy equipment operators are encouraged to keep and\nmaintain their own machine and to operate it at a reasonable salary in\nservice to the community. Companies who own many machines are to be divided\namong the appropriate equipment operators and the rest to be let to valid\noperators on a need basis. Cost of upkeep is charged. A guild of heavy\nmachine operators is recognized for safety and training's sake. Their\ncouncil is a subcouncil to the community council. Etc. Etc. Etc. It isn't\nso hard to think of a better system than we have. All you have to do is\nrealize that the system we have now is not sacrosanct, in fact it's a\nrigged game that steals you blind and is the most unfair any system could\nbe already!!!!!!!! The trick is to realize that the old rich have been\nmaking the rules behind your back and that it's time to kick them off the\nmerry-go-round. Tax the rich to death. They are the ones that converted\nyour 60's school lunch program into the joke it is today. They are the ones\nwho always cut education. They are the ones who always raise the rent when\nyou get a raise. They are the ones who should be not just dislodged but\nkilled for their abuse. I have trouble justifying the death penalty for a\npoor kid who killed and didn't know why not. I have no trouble justifying\nthe death penalty for the rich who steal countless human lives to feed\ntheir greed! Have you paid rent most of your life? Then you have been\nenslaved, percentage wise, most of your life. We used to be serfs. Now we\nare called renters, and we are still enslaved to somebody who claims to own\nland they don't use and make us pay them for it when they did nothing to\nown it. Most rents in California are enough to buy the apartment house,\npaynthe taxes and the insurance and have a little left over to travel with!\nI have seen the books! I know what my landlord pays and to whom! I know\nwhat I pay her. I am being forced to buy her a building and then I will be\nlet out at the other end with nothing, when I had as much right as her to\nlive on this planet! And her child will have the money to likewise\nenslave my child. I hope I find out when I am going to die. I can make\nthings just a little happier form me to be able to destroy her life as she\ndestroyed mine. And maybe I can take a few other landlords with me, and\ntheir heirs. That would be worth it.

An article in yesterday's Atlanta\nJournal stated that there are many scientists who have misgivings that the \ndata being used to determine whether or not global warming is occuring is\nfaulty.

There, runners from around the world\nwere gathered for the fourth lighting of the Peace Torch.\n\nFrom there, Peace Torches are now being transported to over\nseventy countries for a series of concurrent international or\ncross-country relay runs including the United States, Canada,\nJapan, Australia, Russia and Eastern and Western Europe.

Each year the Team\nputs on hundreds of athletic events, including several world-class\nultramarathons, marathons and triathlons, in dozens of countries.\n\nThe Peace Run itself is inspired by the global peace ambassador\nSri Chinmoy, who has written and lectured extensively on peace,\noffered hundreds of free peace concerts and met with countless\nworld figures to advance the cause of international harmony.\n\nThe Run is managed by Peace Runs International, a non-profit\norganization based in the United States.\n\n\n               ----  Take a Step For Peace  ----\n\nThe Peace Runs in 1987, 1989 and 1991 attracted nearly half a\nmillion participants.

The original letters he wrote have\n>>long since decayed into dust.

Somehow I doubt do that yourself\nthat.  Thus since I doubt you accept everything written in every historical\ndocument, I would ask how you can thereby objectively justify complete faith\nin the words of the books attributed to Peter. \n\nI shall now give an example of a document from antiquity, which I am sure you\nreject; it dates from the time of Ramses II (This was first presented here by\nMatthew Wiener).  These inscriptions were carved soon after a battle, and were\ncarved with the Pharoah's specific approval so we have true originals, rather\nthan mere copies.  This account records the the battle of Kadesh (circa 1285\nBC), which occurred on the river Orontes, (about 100 miles south of Aleppo). \nThe Egyptians won this battle with the Hittites, and Ramses had his victory\ninscribed all over the place.  A few of of these inscriptions have survived in\nnear perfect form.  It is a record of how the Pharoah pretty much\nsingle-handedly defeated the Hittites, after being separated from his troops. \n\nNote that the Egyptian wavers back and forth between first and third person. \nThe following is from Miriam Lichtheim`s _Ancient Egyptian Literature_ volume\nII.\n\n\tMy majesty caused the forces of the foes from Hitti to fall\n\ton their faces, one upon the other, as crocodiles fall, into\n\tthe water of the Orontes.  I was after them like a griffin;\n\tI attacked all the countries, I alone.  For my infantry and\n\tmy chariotry had deserted me; not one of them stood looking\n\tback.  As I live, as Ra loves me, as my father Atum favors\n\tme, everything that my majesty has told I did it in truth,\n\tin the presence of my infantry and my chariotry.\n\n(Note: This paragraph records not only Ramses \"divine word,\" but also that\nthere were thousands of witnesses to the event.  Now from the heart of \nbattle.)\n\n\tThen his majesty drove at a gallop and charged the forces\n\tof the Foe from Hitti, being alone by himself, none other\n\twith him.  His majesty proceeded to look about him and\n\tfound 2500 chariots ringing him on his way out ...\n\n\tNo officer was with me, no charioteer,\n\tNo soldier of the army, no shield-bearer;\n\tMy infantry, my chariotry yielded before them,\n\tNot one of them stood firm to fight with them.\n\tHis majesty spoke: \"What is this, father Amun?\n\tIs it right for a father to ignore his son?\n\tAre my deeds a matter for you to ignore?\n\tDo I not walk and stand at your word?\n\tI have not neglected an order you gave.\n\tToo great is he, the great lord of Egypt,\n\tTo allow aliens to step on his path!\n\tWhat are these Asiatics to you, O Amun,\n\tThe wretches ignorant of god?\n\tHave I not made for you many great monuments,\n\t...\n\tI call to you, my father Amun,\n\tI am among a host of strangers;\n\tAll countries are arrayed against me,\n\tI am alone, there's none with me!\n\t...\n\tThe labors of many people are nothing,\n\tAmun is more helpful than they;\n\tI came here by the command of your mouth,\n\tO Amun, I have not transgressed your command!\"\n\n\tNow though I prayed in a distant land,\n\tMy voice resounded in Southern Thebes.\n\tI found Amun came when I called to him,\n\tHe gave me his hand and I rejoiced.\n\tHe called from behind as if near by:\n\t\"Forward, I am with you,\n\tI your father, my hand is with you,\n\tI prevail over a hundred thousand men,\n\tI am lord of victory, lover of valor!\"\n\tI found my heart stout, my breast in joy,\n\tAll I did succeeded, I was like Mont.\n\t...\n\tI slaughtered among them at my will,\n\tNot one looked behind him,\n\tNot one turned around,\n\tWhoever fell down did not rise.\n\t...\n\tOne called out to the other saying:\n\t\"No man is he who is among us,\n\tIt is Seth great-of-strength, Baal in person;\n\tNot deeds of man are these his doings,\n\tThey are of one who is unique,\n\tWho fights a hundred thousand without soldiers and chariots,\n\tCome quick, flee before him,\n\tTo seek life and breathe air;\n\tFor he who attempts to get close to him,\n\tHis hands, all his limbs grow limp.\n\tOne cannot hold either bow or spears,\n\tWhen one sees him come racing along!\"\n\tMy majesty hunted them like a griffin,\n\tI slaughtered among them unceasingly.\n\nSo you see Brian, we have a few original manuscripts recording the miraculous \nbattle between the Ramses and the Hittites.  Do you reject them as being\n*completely* true? I suspect you do, and if so, then do you also, in your own\nwords: \n\n    \"question the existence of Alexander the Great, Tilgrath Pilisar III,\n     Nero, Caligula, Josephus, Cyrus the Great, Artexerxes?\"\n\nDo you also thereby question all their documents? That`s the problem with your\n\"all or nothing\" approach.  Many ancient people used to mix a bit of fancy\nwith their facts.  So for you to say that we must either accept all of Peter\n(and the rest of the New Testament) or accept no records of antiquity at all,\nforces you thereby, to accept the verity of documents you probably do not find\ncompletely credible. \n\nAs to your other argument that so many people have testified to Jesus, that he\nmust be true:\n\n> Are you going to just pass off all this testimony as fictiousness? \n> Are you going to call three thousand years worth of testimony from\n> shepherds to IRS agents to royal officials to kings to computer\n> programmers, fiction?  With a scoff of your keyboard, with near\n> complete ignorance of the testimonies, are you going to say that\n> that is all complete hooey?   Would that not be the most audacious\n> display of arrogance?  Do you actually think you know better than\n> King Solomon, King David, or even Abraham Lincoln?\n \nI have three points.  \n\nFirst, this is \"argumentum ad populum\" (ie: appeal to popular opinion); you\ncannot vote on truth.  For instance, do the millions of Hindu's past and\npresent who testify to the reality of Brahma, constitute actual evidence for\nthe existence of Brahma? How would you answer your own question in regards to\nthe testimony of Hindus:\n\n\t\"With a scoff of your keyboard, with near complete ignorance of \n\t the testimonies, are you going to say that that is all complete \n\t hooey?\"\n\nIf you do so \"scoff,\" then how do you objectively justify your own special\npleading?\n\nSecond, it is not at all clear that King Solomon or King David testified to\nJesus.  You can claim it to be clear, but that does not make it true. \n\nThird, it is quite arguable that Abraham Lincoln was not Christian, and that\nhe had both a public and a private view of Christianity.  In fact there was\nmuch discussion about it in his day (yes, he was publically accused of being a\ndeist.  Oh my).  I am presently collecting a FAQ for Lincoln as I've\npreviously done for Tyre, Jefferson and etc. \n \n\t\t\t\tLater,\n\n\t\t\t\tDave Butler\n\n    \"My earlier views of the unsoundness of the Christian scheme of \n     salvation and the human origin of the scriptures, have become \n     clearer and stronger with advancing years and I see no reason for \n     thinking I shall ever change them.\"\n\t\t\t\t\tAbraham Lincoln\n\t\t\t\t\tTo Judge J S Wakefield \n\t\t\t\t\tafter the death of Willie Lincoln.\n"
