The church, for example,\nforbids that anyone \"produce, describe or use any substance containing...\natoms\". \n\nPHILIP K. DICK\n\nPhilip K. Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short \nstories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable.\nHe wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than\ntechnology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he\nremained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:\n\n\"Galactic Pot-Healer\"\nA fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a\nremote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When the\ndeity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is\nunable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel.\n\n\"A Maze of Death\"\nNoteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.\n\n\"VALIS\"\nThe schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic\nChristianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of\nunknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic and\ndismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.\n\n\"The Divine Invasion\"\nGod invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from\nanother star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be\nassisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.\n\nMARGARET ATWOOD\n\n\"The Handmaid's Tale\"\nA story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously\nassassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it\n\"right\" again.  The book is the diary of a woman's life as she tries to live\nunder the new Christian theocracy.  Women's right to own property is revoked,\nand their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the\nradio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished\nretroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the \"old world\" are\nhunted down and hanged.  Atwood's writing style is difficult to get used to\nat first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.\n\nVARIOUS AUTHORS\n\n\"The Bible\"\nThis somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.  However, it\nis probably worth reading, if only so that you'll know what all the fuss is\nabout.  It exists in many different versions, so make sure you get the one\ntrue version.\n\n                             Books -- Non-fiction\n\nPETER DE ROSA\n\n\"Vicars of Christ\", Bantam Press, 1988\nAlthough de Rosa seems to be Christian or even Catholic this is a very\nenlighting history of papal immoralities, adulteries, fallacies etc.\n(German translation: \"Gottes erste Diener. Die dunkle Seite des Papsttums\",\nDroemer-Knaur, 1989)\n\nMICHAEL MARTIN\n\n\"Atheism: A Philosophical Justification\", Temple University Press,\n Philadelphia, USA.\nA detailed and scholarly justification of atheism.  Contains an outstanding\nappendix defining terminology and usage in this (necessarily) tendentious\narea.  Argues both for \"negative atheism\" (i.e. the \"non-belief in the\nexistence of god(s)\") and also for \"positive atheism\" (\"the belief in the\nnon-existence of god(s)\").  Includes great refutations of the most\nchallenging arguments for god; particular attention is paid to refuting\ncontempory theists such as Platinga and Swinburne.\n541 pages. ISBN 0-87722-642-3 (hardcover; paperback also available)\n\n\"The Case Against Christianity\", Temple University Press\nA comprehensive critique of Christianity, in which he considers\nthe best contemporary defences of Christianity and (ultimately)\ndemonstrates that they are unsupportable and/or incoherent.\n273 pages. ISBN 0-87722-767-5\n\nJAMES TURNER\n\n\"Without God, Without Creed\", The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore,\n MD, USA\nSubtitled \"The Origins of Unbelief in America\".  Examines the way in which\nunbelief (whether agnostic or atheistic)  became a mainstream alternative\nworld-view.  Focusses on the period 1770-1900, and while considering France\nand Britain the emphasis is on American, and particularly New England\ndevelopments.  \"Neither a religious history of secularization or atheism,\nWithout God, Without Creed is, rather, the intellectual history of the fate\nof a single idea, the belief that God exists.\" \n316 pages. ISBN (hardcover) 0-8018-2494-X (paper) 0-8018-3407-4\n\nGEORGE SELDES (Editor)\n\n\"The great thoughts\", Ballantine Books, New York, USA\nA \"dictionary of quotations\" of a different kind, concentrating on statements\nand writings which, explicitly or implicitly, present the person's philosophy\nand world-view.  Includes obscure (and often suppressed) opinions from many\npeople.  For some popular observations, traces the way in which various\npeople expressed and twisted the idea over the centuries.  Quite a number of\nthe quotations are derived from Cardiff's \"What Great Men Think of Religion\"\nand Noyes' \"Views of Religion\".\n490 pages. ISBN (paper) 0-345-29887-X.\n\nRICHARD SWINBURNE\n\n\"The Existence of God (Revised Edition)\", Clarendon Paperbacks, Oxford\nThis book is the second volume in a trilogy that began with \"The Coherence of\nTheism\" (1977) and was concluded with \"Faith and Reason\" (1981).  In this\nwork, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the\nexistence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely\nupon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and\naesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were\ndecisively rejected in Mackie's \"The Miracle of Theism\".  In the revised\nedition of \"The Existence of God\", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he\nmakes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.\n\nJ. L. MACKIE\n\n\"The Miracle of Theism\", Oxford\nThis (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal\narguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical\nphilosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through\nthe moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements\nof the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those\npositions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational,\nsuch as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as \"replacements for\nGod\" such as Lelie's axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - less\nformalistic and better written than Martin's works, and refreshingly direct\nwhen compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.\n\nJAMES A. HAUGHT\n\n\"Holy Horrors: An Illustrated History of Religious Murder and Madness\",\n Prometheus Books\nLooks at religious persecution from ancient times to the present day -- and\nnot only by Christians.\nLibrary of Congress Catalog Card Number 89-64079. 1990.\n\nNORM R.

I argued this thoroughly about 3-4 weeks ago.  Men and women are\ndifferent ... physically, physiologically, and psychologically.  Much\nrecent evidence for this statement is present in the book \"Brainsex\" by\nAnne Moir and David Jessel.  I recommend you find a copy and read it.\nTheir book is an overview of recent scientific research on this topic\nand is well referenced. \n\nNow, if women and men are different in some ways, the law can only\nadequately take into account their needs in these areas where they are\ndifferent by also taking into account the ways in which men and women\nare different.  Maternity leave is an example of this -- it takes into\naccount that women get pregnant.  It does not give women the same rules\nit would give to men, because to treat women like it treats men in this\ninstance would be unjust.  This is just simply an obvious example of\nwhere men and women are intrinsically different!!!!!\n\nNow, people make the _naive_ argument that sexism = oppression.\nHowever, maternity leave is sexist because MEN DO NOT GET PREGNANT. \nMen do not have the same access to leave that women do (not to the same\nextent or degree), and therefore IT IS SEXIST.  No matter however much a\nman _wants_ to get pregnant and have maternity leave, HE NEVER CAN.  And\ntherefore the law IS SEXIST.  No man can have access to maternity leave,\nNO MATTER HOW HARD HE TRIES TO GET PREGNANT.  I hope this is clear.\n\nMaternity leave is an example where a sexist law is just, because the\nsexism here just reflects the \"sexism\" of nature in making men and women\ndifferent.  There are many other differences between men and women which\nare far more subtle than pregnancy, and to find out more of these I\nrecommend you have a look at the book \"Brainsex\".\n\nYour point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant is fallacious.\nIf men can one day become pregnant it will be by having biologically\nbecome women!  To have a womb and the other factors required for\npregnancy is usually wrapped up in the definition of what a woman is --\nso your argument, when it is examined, is seen to be fallacious.  You\nare saying that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that \nwomen can have if they also become women -- which actually just supports\nmy statement that maternity leave is sexist.\n\n>The discrimination comes in when a woman is denied opportunities\n>because of her (legally determined) sexual inferiorities.  As I\n>understand most religious sexual discrimination, and I doubt that\n>Islam is exceptional, the female is not allowed into the priestly\n>caste and in general is subjugated so that she has no aspirations to\n>rights which, as an equal human, she ought to be entitled to.\n\nThere is no official priesthood in Islam -- much of this function is\ntaken by Islamic scholars.  There are female Islamic scholars and\nfemale Islamic scholars have always existed in Islam.  An example from\nearly Islamic history is the Prophet's widow, Aisha, who was recognized\nin her time and is recognized in our time as an Islamic scholar.\n\n>No matter how sweetly you coat it, part of the role of religions\n>seems, historically, to have served the function of oppressing the\n>female, whether by forcing her to procreate to the extent where\n>there is no opportunity for self-improvement, or by denying her\n>access to the same facilities the males are offered.\n\nYou have no evidence for your blanket statement about all religions, and\nI dispute it.  I could go on and on about women in Islam, etc., but I\nrecently reposted something here under the heading \"Islam and Women\" --\nif it is still at your news-site I suggest you read it.  It is reposted\nfrom soc.religion.islam, so if it has disappeared from alt.atheism it\nstill might be in soc.religion.islam (I forgot what its original title\nwas though).  I will email it to you if you like. \n\n>The Roman Catholic Church is the most blatant of the culprit,\n>because they actually istitutionalised a celibate clergy, but the\n>other religious are no different: let a woman attempt to escape her\n>role as child bearer and the wrath of god descends on her.\n\nYour statement that \"other religions are no different\" is, I think, a\nstatement based simply on lack of knowledge about religions other than\nChristianity and perhaps Judaism.\n\n>I'll accept your affirmation that Islam grants women the same rights\n>as men when you can show me that any muslim woman can aspire to the\n>same position as (say) Khomeini and there are no artificial religious\n>or social obstacles on her path to achieve this.\n\nAisha, who I mentioned earlier, was not only an Islamic scholar but also\nwas, at one stage, a military leader.\n\n>Show me the equivalent of Hillary Rhodam-Clinton within Islam, and I\n>may consider discussing the issue with you.\n\nThe Prophet's first wife, who died just before the \"Hijra\" (the\nProphet's journey from Mecca to Medina) was a successful businesswoman.\n\nLucio, you cannot make a strong case for your viewpoint when your\nviewpoint is based on ignorance about world religions.\n\n Fred Rice\n darice@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au   \n"

If this has already disappeared from your site,\nthen please email me telling me so and I will email you a copy of this\nexcellent article.  \n\nIMHO, your understanding of the issue of women in Islam is sadly deficient.\n\nRegarding slaves, _my_ posting on slavery -- the second one I made,\nwhich is a repost of an article I wrote early last year -- is based\ncompletely on the Qur'an and contains numerous Qur'anic verses and\nhadiths to support its point of view.\n\nOur approaches are different -- you are arguing from a historical\nstandpoint and I am arguing directly from the teachings of the Qur'an\nand hadiths.  Now, just because people say they are Muslims and perform\na particular action, does that automatically mean that their action is\npart of Islam, even if it is opposed by the Qur'an and Sunnah?  No!  Of\ncourse not.\n\nLet me give you a concrete example, which might help clarify this for\nyou.  The Qur'an prohibits drinking.  Now, if a person says \"I am a\nMuslim\" and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer, does this now mean\nthat Islam teaches that people should drink beer?  Of course not, and\nonly an idiot would think so.\n\nDo you see my point?\n\n>It is very natural to think that\n>the author/authors of the Quran had no idea that the socio-economic\n>structure they were advocating would experience at least two paradigm\n>shifts in 1400 years in the western cultures - first with the end of \n>the feudal era and the rise of commerce, second with the industrial \n>revolution.

Capitalism is an\nideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise\ntheir wealth -- this assumption is in opposition to Islamic teachings.\nTo say Islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking --\nIslam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be\ncapitalist.  (This does not mean that Islam does not support a\nfree-market -- for it does in general -- but there are other parts of \ncapitalism which are opposed to Islam as I understand it.)\n\n>When this stopped,\n>you (and I) were left bare in the open for emperialists to devour.\n>No capital, no industry, very poor social services - the education\n>level in Muslim countries are the lowest in the world, the health\n>statistics are miserable etc.. \n\nOne can postulate numerous reasons for this.  Your theory is that it is\nbecause Islam is not secularist and capitalist, etc. etc.\n\nSelim, I will give you a clear historical example to show you the\nfallacy of your views if you think (as you obviously do) that\nIslam => lack of education and power.\n\nFor a large part of history, the Islamic world was very powerful.  For a\nsignificant section of history, the Islamic world was the foremost in\nthe sciences.  So to say that Islam is, for example, anti-education is\ncompletely absurd.

Yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history!\n\nSelim, if I remember right, you say in one of your earlier posts that\nyou are an apostate from Islam.

Your generalisms\nare then misplaced -- atheism needn't imply materialism, or the lack\nof an absolute moral system.  However, I do tend to materialism and\ndon't believe in absolute morality, so I'll answer your questions.\n\n>How then can an atheist judge value? \n\nAn atheist judges value in the same way that a theist does: according\nto a personal understanding of morality.  That I don't believe in an\nabsolute one doesn't mean that I don't have one.  I'm just explicit,\nas in the line of postings you followed up, that when I express\njudgment on a moral issue I am basing my judgment on my own code\nrather than claiming that it is in some absolute sense good or bad.\nMy moral code is not particular different from that of others around\nme, be they Christians, Muslims, or atheists.  So when I say that I\nobject to genocide, I'm not expressing anything particularly out of\nline with what my society holds.\n\nIf your were to ask why I think morality exists and has the form it\ndoes, my answer would be mechanistic to your taste -- that a moral\ncode is a prerequisite for a functioning society, and that humanity\nprobably evolved morality as we know it as part of the evolution of\nour ability to exist in large societies, thereby achieving\nconsiderable survival advantages.  You'd probably say that God just\nmade the rules.  Neither of us can convince the other, but we share a\ncommon understanding about many moral issues.  You think you get it\nfrom your religion, I think I get it (and you get it) from early\nchildhood teaching.\n\n>That you don't like what God told people to do says nothing about God\n>or God's commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your\n>nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled\n>with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. \n\nI think you've been reading the wrong sort of comic books, but in\nprying through the gobbledygook I basically agree with what you're\nsaying.  I do believe that my mental reactions to stimuli such as \"God\ncommanded the genocide of the Canaanites\" is mechanistic, but of\ncourse I think that's true of you as well.  My reaction has little to\ndo with whether God exists or even with whether I think he does, but\nif a god existed who commanded genocide, I could not consider him\ngood, which is supposedly an attribute of God.\n\n>All of this being so, you have excluded\n>yourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil,\n>etc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no\n>weight whatsoever.\n\nHmm.  Yes, I think some heavy FAQ-reading would do you some good.  I\nhave as much place discussing values etc. as any other person.  In\nfact, I can actually accomplish something in such a discussion, by\nframing the questions in terms of reason: for instance, it is clear\nthat in an environment where neighboring tribes periodically attempt\nto wipe each other out based on imagined divine commands, then the\nquality of life will be generally poor, so a system that fosters\ncoexistence is superior, if quality of life is an agreed goal.  An\nabsolutist, on the other hand, can only thump those portions of a\nBible they happen to agree with, and say \"this is good\", even if the\nact in question is unequivocally bad by the standards of everyone in\nthe discussion.  The attempt to define someone or a group of people as\n\"excluded from discussion\", such that they \"cannot participate\", and\ntheir opinions given \"no weight whatsoever\" is the lowest form or\nreasoning (ad hominem/poisoning the well), and presumably the resort\nof someone who can't rationally defend their own ideas of right,\nwrong, and the Bible.\n-- \nJim Perry   perry@dsinc.com   Decision Support, Inc., Matthews NC\nThese are my opinions.

We have here the quintessential Christian: he sets up a\nsystem of values/beliefs for himself, which work very well, and every\nevent/experience is understandable and deablable within the framework of this\nsystem.  However, we also have an individual who has the inability (at least\nnot without some difficulty) to change, which is important, because the problem\nwith such a system is the same as with any system: one cannot be open minded to\nthe point of \"testing hypotheses\" against the basic premise of the system\nwithout destroying whatever faith is invested therein, unless of course, all\nthe tests fail.  In other words, the *fairer* way would be to test and evaluate\nmoralities without the bias/responsibility of losing/retaining a system.\n\n> \n> I claimed that a ``Christian philosopher'' is not a Christian,\n> but is a person whose beliefs at the moment correspond with those\n> of Christianity.

For\ninstance, 'No one should ever deliberately inflict pain on another\nsimply to take pleasure in his suffering' might be thought of as a\nplausible example.  Even in a world of sadists who all rejected it, the\ncontention remains true, just as '5 + 7 = 12' remains correct even if\nthere is no one left to count.  The problem for the objectivist is to\ndetermine the status of moral truths and the method by which they can be\nestablished.  If we accept that such judgements are not reports of what\nis but only relate to what ought to be (see naturalistic fallacy) then\nthey cannot be proved by any facts about the nature of the world.  Nor\ncan they be analytic, since this would involve lack of action-guiding\ncontent;  'One ought always to do the right thing' is plainly true in\nvirtue of the vords involved but it is unhelpful as a practical guide to\naction (see analytic and synthetic).  At this point the objectivist may\ntalk of 'self-evident truths', but can he deny the subjectivist's claim\nthat self-evidence is in the mind of the beholder?  If not, what is left\nof the claim that some moral judgements are true?  THe subjectivist may\nwell feel that all that remains is that there are some moral judgements\nwith which he would wish to associate himself.

El-Awa (American Trust Publications, 1981).\n> \n\nI reiterate that I would agree with you that there is little\njustification for the punishment of apostasy in the Qur'an.\nIn Islamic history, as well, apostasy has rarely been punished. \nBelief is considered a matter of conscience and since there\nis to be no compulsion in the matter of belief, apostates have\nbeen generally left to believe or not believe as they will.\n\nHowever, when an apostate makes attacks upon \"God and\nHis Messenger\" the situation changes. Now the charge of\napostasy may be complicated with other charges - perhaps \ncharges of sedition, treason, spying, etc. If the person \nmakes a public issue of their apostasy or mounts public\nattacks (as opposed to arguement) against Islam, the\nsituation is likewise complicated. If the person spreads\nslander or broadcasts falsehoods, again the situation\nchanges. The punishments vary according to the situation\nthe apostate is in. Anyhow, the charge of aggravated\napostasy would only be a subsidiary charge in Rushdie's case.\n\nThere is a distinction in the Qur'an between a formal war situation\nand being in the situation where someone unilaterally\nwages war (by their actions), creates disorder, makes mischief,etc. \nagainst the Muslims and creates a situation that results in harm \nto Muslims. Here, a small group or even a single individual could\nbe said to be engaged in such a practise. In other words, there is\na clear difference between a formal war situation (where two\nclearly defined parties wage war, conclude treaties, exchange\nprisoners, etc.), and dealing with attacks that come from isolated\nindividuals or groups against Islam. It is the second situation, \nthe unilateral attack and the spreading of \"fasad\" that \nwould apply in the case of Rushdie.\n\nThe matter of Rushdie is not a simple matter of banning an \noffensive book (banning the book is secondary) -\na full set of circumstances following the publication of\nthe book come into play as well, including the deaths of many\nMuslims, and Rushdie's (and his publishers) Media games.\n\n\n> Now, I do not believe in _blindly_ following anyone, no matter\n> how knowledgeable he or she may be in Islamic law.

I believe\nthat one of the Qur'anic verses on which the fatwa is based is 5:33.\nEvery verse in the Qur'an has a corresponding \"circumstance of\nrevelation\" but in no way is the understanding (the tafsir) of the\nverse restricted solely to the particular historical circumstance\nin which it was revealed. If this was the case then we could say\nthat all the laws and regulations that were revealed when the\nMuslims were NOT involved in conflict, should be suspended when\nthey were at war. The logic does not follow. In complex, real-life\nsituations, there may be many verses and many hadiths which can\nall be related to a single, complicated situation. The internal\nrelationships between these verses may be quite complex, such that\narriving at an understanding of how the verses interlock and how\neach applies to the particular situation can be quite a demanding task.\nIt is not necessarily a simple \"this or that\" process. There may\nbe many parameters involved, there may be a larger context in\nwhich a particular situation should be viewed. All these matters\nimpinge on the situation.\n\nIn other words there is a great deal involved in deciphering the Qur'an.\nThe Qur'an asks us to reflect on its verses, but this reflection must\nentail more than simply reading a verse and its corresponding hadith.\nIf the reflection is for the sake of increasing personal piety, then each\nperson has his own level of understanding and there is no harm in that.\nHowever, if the reflection is in order to decide matters that pertain to\nthe\nState, to the gestation of laws and rulings, to the gestation of society,\nthe dispensing of justice, the guidance of the community, then there \nare certain minimum requirements of understanding that one \nshould achieve. Jaffar Ibn Muhammad as-Sadiq(a.s.) relates some of \nthese requirements, as taught by the Prophet(S.A.), in a hadith:\n\n\"...he who does not distinguish in the Book of Allah the abrogating\nverse from the abrogated one, and a specific one from a general one,\nand a decisive from an ambiguous; and does not differentiate between\na permission and an obligation, and does not recognize a verse of\nMeccan period from a Medinite one, and does not know the circumstances \nof revelation, and does not understand the technical words of\nthe Qur'an (whether simple or compound); and does not comprehend the\nknowledge of decree and measure, and is ignorant of advancing and\ndelaying (in its verses); and does not distinguish the clear from\nthe deep, nor the manifest from the esoteric, nor the beginning\nfrom the termination; and is unaware of the question and the answer,\nthe disjoining and the joining, and the exceptions and the all-inclusive,\nand is ignorant of an adjective of a preceding noun that explains the\nsubsequent one; and is unaware of the emphasized subject and the\ndetailed one, the obligatory laws and the permissions, the places of the\nduties and rules, and the meaning of the lawful and the unlawful; and\ndoes not know the joined words, and the words that are related to those\ncoming before them, or after them - then such a man does not know\nthe Qur'an; nor is he among the people of the Qur'an....\".\n\nBased on these and other hadiths, and in accordance with many Qur'anic\nverses (\"Why should not a company from every group remain behind \nto gain profound understanding (tafaqquh) in religion and to warn \npeople when they return to them, so that they may beware.\" (9:122)),\na science of jurisprudence arose. The requirements\nfor a person to be considered a mujtahid (one who can pronounce on\nmatters of law and religion) are many. I've listed a few major \ndivisions below - there are, of course, many subdivisions within these\nheadings.\n\n- Knowledge of Arabic (syntax, conjugation, roots, semantics, oratory).\n- Knowledge of tafsir and principles of tafsir.\n- Logic (mantiq)\n- A knowledge of Hadiths\n- A knowledge of transmitters (rijal)\n- Knowledge of the principles of juriprudence (Qur'an, Sunnah, Consensus,\nReasoning)\n\nThe study of Qur'an and sunnah for purposes of law involves:\n- discussion of imperatives (awamir)\n- discussion of negative imperatives (nawahi)\n- discussion of generalities and particularities (aam wa khas)\n- discussion of unconditional and conditional\n- discussion of tacit meanings\n- discussion of the abstract and the clear\n- discussion of the abrogator and the abrogated\n\nThe principles of Application of the law involves:\n- principles of exemption\n- principles of precaution\n- principles of option\n- principles of mastery\n\nThe jurisprudent is bound to go through a very rigorous process\nin pronouncing judgement on a given situation. It is not a matter\nof looking at one verse and one hadith. \n\nNow no one should blindly follow anyone, but there is a difference\nbetween blind following and acceding to the opinion of someone who is\nclearly more knowledgeable and more qualified than oneself. There is the\nfamous hadith of the Prophet (S.A.) in which he says:\n\"The fuqaha (religious scholars) are the trustees of the Prophet, as \nlong as they do not concern themselves with the illicit desires, pleasures,\nand wealth of this world.\" The Prophet (S.A.) was asked: \"O Messenger\nof God! How may we know if they so concern themselves?\" He (S.A.) replied:\n\"By seeing whether they follow the ruling power. If they do that, fear for\nyour religion and shun them.\" I do not yet know enough about the Imams\nof the four Sunni madhabs to comment on how this hadith applies\nto them or to the contemporary scholars who base themselves upon them.\n\nThe Prophet also refered to the fuqaha as \"The fortress of Islam\". My only\npoint is to make it clear that arriving at a legal judgement calls into\nplay a certain amount of expertise - the specifics of this expertise is \ndelineated in the Qur'an and hadith. Those who acquire this expertise\nare praised in both the Qur'an and hadith - those who without the requisite\nknowledge pronounce on matters that affect society, state, and religion \nare cautioned.\n\nThe only reason I said anything at all about the Rushdie affair in this\ngroup, is because the whole basis for the discussion of the fatwa (that is,\napostasy), was wrong. When one discusses something they should at least\nbase their discussion on fact. Secondly, Khomeini was condemned as a\nheretic\nbecause he supposedly claimed to be infallible - another instance of\ncreating a straw man and then beating him.\n\n> Perhaps we should take our discussion to soc.religion.islam.  Please\n> email me, Rashid, if you think we should do this.\n\nI agree that we should move the discussion to another newsgroup.\nUnfortunately,\nI do not have any access to email, so private discussion or a moderated\ngroup\nis out of the question (I cannot post to a moderated group like\nsoc.religion.islam. How about soc.culture.arabic or talk.religion.misc?\n\nAs salaam a-laikum\n"

It's from\n\n  P(H)  =  P(HG) +  P(HG')  where G' is the complement of G\n\nand by axiom, P(anything) >= 0, so P(HG') >= 0, so P(H) >= P(HG).\n\nIn a sense, HG is necessarily more \"complicated\" than H for any H and G,\nso I may be splitting hairs, but what I'm trying to say is that irrespective\nof subjective impressions of how complicated something is, P(H) >= P(HG)\nholds, with equality if and only if P(HG') = 0.\n\n> As you point out, it's a very simple matter to show P(x | H) = P(x | HG)\n> ==> P(H | x) > P(HG | x), and thus H is to be preferd to HG. Now to say\n> that H is as consistent with the data as HG is to say P(x | H) =  P(x | HG).\n> Can you elaborate some on this.\n\nWell, \"P(x | A) = P(x | B)\" means that x is as likely to be observed if A is\noperative as it is if B is operative. This implies that observing x does not\nprovide any useful information which might allow us to discriminate between\nthe respective possibilities that A and B are operative; the difference\nreduces to the difference between the (unknown and unhelpful) prior\nprobabilities P(A) and P(B):\n\n  P(x | A) = P(x | B)  ==>\n\n    P(A | x)  =  k P(A),   and   P(B | x)  =  k P(B)\n\nwhere k  =  P(x | A) / P(x)  =  P(x | B) / P(x).\n\nSo A and B are \"equally consistent with the data\" in that observing x\ndoesn't give any pointers as to which of A or B is operative.\n\nIn the particular case where A = H and B = HG, however, we know that their\nprior probabilities are ordered by P(H) >= P(HG), although we don't know\nthe actual values, and it's this which allows us to deploy the Razor to\nthrow out any such HG.\n\n> Also, in the \"real world\" it isn't as clear cut and dry it seems \n> to me. We can't always determine whether the equality \"P(x | H) =  \n> P(x | HG)\" is true. \n\nThat's certainly true, but the particular point here was whether or\nnot a `divine component' actually underlies the prevalence of religion\nin addition to the memetic transmission component, which even the religious\nimplicitly acknowledge to be operative when they talk of `spreading the word'.\n\nNow it seems to me, as I've said, that the observed variance in religious\nbelief is well accounted for by the memetic transmission model, but rather\n*less* well if one proposes a `divine component' in addition, since I would\nexpect the latter to conspire *against* wide variance and even mutual\nexclusion among beliefs. Thus my *personal* feeling is that P(x | HG) isn't\neven equal to P(x | H) in this case, but is smaller (H is memetic transmission,\nG is `divine component', x is the variance among beliefs). But I happily\nacknowledge that this is a subjective impression.\n\n> BTW, my beef with your Baysian argument was not a mathematical one - \n> I checked most of your work and didn't find an error and you seem very  \n> careful so there probably isn't a \"math mistake\".

I'm not a Baysian statistician (nor any type of \n> statistician), so this would be very helpful. \n\nNot that I'm a statistician as such either, but:\n\nThe idea is that both theism and atheism are compatible with all of\nthe (read `my') observations to date. However, theism (of the type with\nwhich I am concerned) *also* suggests that, for instance, prayer may be\nanswered, people may be miraculously healed (both are in principle amenable\nto statistical verification) and that god/s may generally intervene in\nmeasurable ways.\n\nThis means that these regions of the space of possible observations, \nwhich I loosely termed \"appearances of god/s\", have some nonzero\nprobability under the theistic hypothesis and zero under the atheistic.\n\nSince there is only so much probability available for each hypothesis to\nscatter around over the observation space, the probability which theism\nexpends on making \"appearances of god/s\" possible must come from somewhere\nelse (i.e. other possible observations).\n\nAll else being equal, this means that an observation which *isn't* an\n\"appearance of god/s\" must have a slightly higher probability under\natheism than under theism. The Bayesian stuff implies that such\nobservations must cause my running estimate for the probability of\nthe atheistic hypothesis to increase, with a corresponding decrease\nin my running estimate for the probability of the theistic hypothesis.\n\nSorry if that's still a bit jargonesque, but it's rather difficult to\nput it any other way, since it does depend intimately on the properties\nof conditional probability densities, and particularly that the total\narea under them is always unity.\n\nAn analogy may (or may not :-) be helpful. Say that hypothesis A is \"the\ncoin is fair\", and that B is \"the coin is unfair (two-headed)\". (I've\nused A and B to avoid confusion with H[heads] and T[tails].)\n\nThen\n\n  P(H | A) = 0.5  }  total 1\n  P(T | A) = 0.5  }\n\n  P(H | B) = 1    }  total 1\n  P(T | B) = 0    }\n\nThe observations are a string of heads, with no tails. This is compatible\nwith both a fair coin (A) and a two-headed coin (B). However, the probability\nexpended by A on making possible the appearance of tails (even though they\ndon't actually appear) must come from somewhere else, since the total must\nbe unity, and it comes in this case from the probability of the appearance\nof heads.\n\nSay our running estimates at time n-1 are e[n-1](A) and e[n-1](B). The\nobservation x[n] at time n is another head, x[n] = H. The estimates are\nmodified according to\n\n                            P(H | A)\n  e[n](A)   =   e[n-1](A) * --------   =   e[n-1](A) * m\n                              P(H)\n\nand\n\n                            P(H | B)\n  e[n](B)   =   e[n-1](B) * --------   =   e[n-1](B) * 2m\n                              P(H)\n\nNow we don't know P(H), the *actual* prior probability of a head, but\nthe multiplier for e(A) is half that for e(B). This is true every time\nthe coin is tossed and a head is observed.\n\nThus whatever the initial values of the estimates, after n heads, we have\n\n                 n\n  e[n](A)   =   m  e[0](A)\n\nand\n                    n\n  e[n](B)   =   (2m)  e[0](B),\n\nand since e[k](A) + e[k](B) = 1 at any time k, you can show that 0.5 < m < 1\nand thus 1 < 2m < 2. Hence the estimate for the fair-coin hypothesis A must\ndecrease at each trial and that for the two-headed coin hypothesis B must\nincrease, even though both hypotheses are compatible with a string of heads.\n\nThe loose analogy is between \"unfair coin\" and atheism, and between \"fair\ncoin\" and theism, with observations consistent with both. A tail, which\nwould falsify \"unfair coin\", is analogous to an \"appearance of god/s\",\nwhich would falsify atheism. I am *not* claiming that the analogy extends\nto the numerical values of the various probabilities, just that the principle\nis the same.\n\n>> Constant observation of no evidence for gods, if evidence for them \n>                                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n>> is at all possible under the respective theisms, constantly increases\n>  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n>> the notional estimated probability that they don't exist, \n\n> It's important to draw a distinction between theism that could\n> be supported or not supported by evidence and theism that can't.\n> Given a theism for which evidence is in principle not possible,\n> it doesn't make sense to say \"lack of evidence\" supports the contrary \n> view.\n\nQuite so, but this type of theism is what I might call \"the G in the HG\",\nin terms of our Ockham's Razor discussion, and I'd bin it on those grounds.\n\n> So it depends upon your conception of this god.

It's clear that after a large number of observations, P(fair-coin)\napproaches zero and P(two-headed-coin) approaches unity.\n\nAll you need to know is whether P(x | Ha) is larger than P(x | Ht) for\nobserved x, and this follows from the assumptions that there are certain\nevents rendered *possible* (not necessary) under Ht which are not possible\nunder Ha, and all else is equal.\n\n> Baysian statistics relies upon a series of observations.

(Before somebody points out that quantum\nmechanics doesn't make this prediction either, the difference is that\nQM and atheism do not form a partition.)\n\nPredictions include such statements as \"Prayer is efficacious\" (implying\n\"If you do the stats, you will find that Prayer is efficacious\"), or \"Prayer\nis *not* efficacious\", or \"Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not\npass, till all these things be fulfilled.\" I don't think we have any problems\nof misunderstanding here.\n\n>> Persistent observation of this stuff not happening, *consistent* with\n>> Ht though it may be, is *more* consistent with Ha, as explained in the\n>> Bayesian stats post. \n>>\n>> Even if Ht (\"God exists\") is unfalsifiable, that's\n>> no problem for my argument, other than that you have to let the number \n>> of observations go to infinity to falsify it asymptotically. \n\n> BTW, I do not consider an argument that requires an infinite number of \n> observations as valid - or rather that part of the argument is not valid. \n> We, as existing humans, can never make an infinite number of measurments \n> and any conclusion that reilies on this I don't accept as valid.\n\nThat's fine; I don't claim that theism is false, merely that the [finite\nnumber of] observations available to me so far suggest that it is, and\nthat as I continue to observe, the suggestion looks better and better.\n\n> [Renormalization stuff deleted]\n\n>> In the Bayesian stats post, I assumed that theism was indeed unfalsifiable\n>> in a finite number of observations.

This is unfalsifiable by tossing the coin; even a string of\nheads is consistent with a fair coin, and you have to go to an infinite\nnumber of tosses to falsify X in the limit.

The\nfacts are that less Iraqis died in the Gulf War than did civilians \nin any other war of comparable size this century!  This was due mostly\nto the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques\nwhich were technically possible only recently.\n\nThe idea that \"hundreds of thousands\" of Iraqi citizens died is\nludicrous.  Not even \"hundreds of thousands\" of Iraqi soldiers died,\nand they were the ones being targeted!  Or do you think that the US\nand its allies were specifically out to kill and maim Iraqi civilians?\nEither the smart bombs didn't hit their targets (and we know they did),\nor they were targeting civilian targets (!) which is hardly condusive to\ndestroying Iraq's military potential.  The military mission planners are\nnot fools, they know they have to hit *military* targets to win a war.\nHitting civilian targets does nothing but unite the people against you,\nnot a laudable goal if one wants the people to rise up against their\ntyrant-dictator. \n> \n> OK, so some innocent people died.

War is never an exact science, but\nwith smart bombs, it's becoming more exact with a smaller percentage\nof civilian casualties.  Sometimes mistakes are made; targets are\nmisidentified; innocents die.  That's war the way it really is.\nBut the alternative, to allow tyrannical dictators to treat the earth\nlike it's one big rummage sale, grabbing everything they can get is\nworse.  Like Patrick Henry said some 217 years ago, \"I know not what\ncourse others may take -- but as for me, give me liberty, or give me\ndeath!\"  War is always the price one must be willing to pay if one\nwishes to stay free.   \n\n> \n>> The death penalty was conceived as a deterrent to crime,  but the legal\n>> shenanigans that have been added (automatic appeals, lengthy court\n>> battles, etc.) have relegated that purpose to a very small part of what\n>> it should be.

I'm sure that appeasement would have\nworked better than war, just like it did in WW2, eh?  I guess we\nshouldn't have fought WW2 either -- just think of all those innocent\nGerman civilians killed in Dresden and Hamburg.  How about all the poor \nFrench who died in the crossfire because we invaded the continent?  We \nshould have just let Hitler take over Europe, and you'd be speaking\nGerman instead of English right now.\n\nTyrants like Hussein *have* to be stopped.  His kind don't understand\ndiplomacy; they only understand the point of a gun.  My only regret is\nthat Bush wimped out and didn't have the military roll into Baghdad, so\nnow Hussein is still in power and the Iraqi people's sacrifice (not to\nmention the 357 Americans who died) was for naught.  Liberating Kuwait \nwas a good thing, but wiping Hussein off the map would've been better!\n\nAnd as for poor, poor Rodney King!  Did you ever stop and think *why*\nthe jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of \"not guilty\"?\nThose who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those\npolicemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape.\nBut the jury looked at *all* the evidence, evidence which you and I\nhave not seen.  When one makes a judgment without the benefit of a\ntrial where evidence can be presented on both sides, one has simply\nlowered himself to the level of vigilante justice, a state-of-mind\nwhich your sarcasm above seemingly spoke against, but instead tends\nto support in the case against the policemen.  \n\nLaw in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused,\nwhether they be criminals or cops.  One is not found guilty if there is\na reasonable doubt of one's guilt, and only the jury is in a position\nto assess the evidence and render a verdict.  Anyone else is simply\nsuccumbing to verbal vigilantism.\n       \nRegards,\n\nJim B.\n"

On the drawing you have a set of\nreference points whose true x,y positions are known.  \n\nNow you digitize the drawing manually (in this case, using Yaron\nDanon's excellent Digitize program).  That is, you use a program which\nconverts cursor positions to x,y and saves those values when you click\nthe mouse.\n\nUpon digitizing you notice that the reference point values that come\nout of the digitizing process differ in small but significant ways\nfrom the known true values.  This is understandable because the\nscanned drawing is a reproduction of the original and there are\nsuccessive sources of distortion such as differential expansion and\ncontraction of paper, errors introduced in the printing process,\nscanner errors and what have you.\n\nThe errors are not uniform over the entire drawing, so \"global\"\nadjustments such as stretching/contracting uniformly over x or y, or\nrotating the whole drawing, are not satisfactory.\n\nSo the question is: does any kind soul know of an algorithm for\nremoving such distortion?  In particular, if I have three sets of\npoints \n\nReference(x,y) (the known true values)\n\nDistortedReference(x,y) (the same points, with known errors)\n\nDistortedData(x,y) (other points, with unknown errors)\n\nwhat function of Reference and Distorted could I apply to\nDistortedData to remove the errors.\n\nI suspect the problem could be solved by treating the distorted\nreference points as resulting from the projection of a \"bumpy\" 3d\nsurface, solving for the surface and then \"flattening\" it to remove\nthe errors in the other data points.\n\nAny kind and informed soul out there have any ideas, or better yet,\npointers to treatments of the same or similar problems?\n\nThanks,\n\nEarl\n\n\n"

It is not bad error to program a program for 8bit images only\nat that time, but when 24bit image formats are included to program the\nwhole design should be changed to support 24bit images.\nThat were not done and now we have\n -the program violate jpeg design (and any 24bit image format)\n -the program has human interface errors.\n\nOtherway is to drop saving images as jpegs or any 24bit format without\nclearly saying that it is special case and not expected in normal use.\n\n[ ..deleted.. ]\n\n==clip==\n\nSome new items follows.\n\n==clip==\n\nI have seen that XV quantizes the image sometimes poorly with -best24\noption than with default option we have.\nThe reason surely is the quantizer used as -best24; it is (surprise)\nthe same than used in ppmquant.\n\nIf you remember, I have tested some quantizers. In that test I found\nthat rlequant (with default) is best, then comes djpeg, fbmquant, xv\n(our default) in that order. In my test ppmquant suggeeded very poorly\n-- it actually gave image with bad artifacts.\n\nI don't know is ppmquant improved any, but I expect no.\nSo, use of XV's -best24 option is not very good idea.\n\nI suggest that author of XV changes the quantizer to the one used in\nrlequant -- I'm sure rle-people gives permission.\n(Another could be one used in ImageMagick; I have not tested it, so I\ncan say nothing about it.)\n\n==clip==\n\n==clip==\n\nSome minor bugs in human interface are:\n\nKey pressings and cursor clicks goes to a buffer; Often it happens\nthat I make click errors or press keyboard when cursor is in the wrong\nplace. It is very annoying when you have waited image to come about\nfive minutes and then it is gone away immediately.\nThe buffer should be cleaned when the image is complete.\n\nAlso, good idea is to wait few seconds before activating keyboard\nand mouse for XV after the image is completed.\nOften it happens that image pops to the screen quickly, just when\nI'm writing something with editor or such. Those key pressings\nthen go to XV and image has gone or something weird.\n\nIn the color editor, when I turn a color meter and release it, XV\nupdates the images. It is impossible to change all RGB values first\nand then get the updated image. It is annoying wait image to be\nupdated when the setting are not ready yet.\nI suggest of adding an 'apply' button to update the exchanges done.\n\n==clip==\n"

                    "content": "From: ed@cwis.unomaha.edu (Ed Stastny)\nSubject: The OTIS Project (FTP sites for original art and images)\n\n\n\t-------------------------------------\n\t+ ............The OTIS Project '93  +      \n\t+ \"The Operative Term Is STIMULATE\" + \n\t-------------------------------------\n\t---this file last updated..4-21-93---\n\n\nWHAT IS OTIS?\n\nOTIS is here for the purpose of distributing original artwork\nand photographs over the network for public perusal, scrutiny,    \nand distribution.  Digital immortality.\n\nThe basic idea behind \"digital immortality\" is that computer networks   \nare here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them\nwill be around near-forever.  The GIFs and JPGs of today will be the\nartifacts of a digital future.  Perhaps they'll be put in different\nformats, perhaps only surviving on backup tapes....but they'll be\nthere...and someone will dig them up.  \n \nIf that doesn't interest you... OTIS also offers a forum for critique\nand exhibition of your works....a virtual art gallery that never closes\nand exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang\nas wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors.  Suddenly, life is \nbreathed into your work...and by merit of it's stimulus, it will \ntravel the globe on pulses of light and electrons.\n \nSpectators are welcome also, feel free to browse the gallery and \nlet the artists know what you think of their efforts.  Keep your own\ncopies of the images to look at when you've got the gumption...\nthat's what they're here for.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWHERE?             \n\nOTIS currently (as of 4/21/93) has two FTP sites.  \n \n \t141.214.4.135 (projects/otis), the UWI site\n\t\t\n\tsunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS), the SUNsite \n\t(you can also GOPHER to this site for OTIS as well)\n\nMerely \"anonymous FTP\" to either site on Internet and change to the\nappropriate directory.  Don't forget to get busy and use the \"bin\"\ncommand to make sure you're in binary.\n\nOTIS has also been spreading to some dial-up BBS systems around North\nAmerica....the following systems have a substancial supply of\nOTIStuff...\n\tUnderground Cafe (Omaha) (402.339.0179) 2 lines\n\tCyberDen (SanFran?) (415.472.5527)  Usenet Waffle-iron\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n \nHOW DO YOU CONTRIBUTE?\n              \nWhat happens is...you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely   \nphoto, get it scanned into an image file, then either FTP-put\nit in the CONTRIB/Incoming directory or use UUENCODE to send it to me\n(email addresses at eof) in email.  After the image is received,\nit will be put into the correct directory.  Computer originated works\nare also welcome.\n\nOTIS' directories house two types of image files, GIF and JPG.  \nGIF and JPG files require, oddly enough, a GIF or JPG viewer to \nsee.  These viewers are available for all types of computers at \nmost large FTP sites around Internet.  JPG viewers are a bit\ntougher to find.  If you can't find one, but do have a GIF viewer,  \nyou can obtain a JPG-to-GIF conversion program which will change    \nJPG files to a standard GIF format. \n\nOTIS also accepts animation files.      \n\nWhen you submit image files, please send me email at the same time\nstating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be\nused (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for people\nto view.  Also, include some biographical information on yourself, we'll\nbe having info-files on each contributing artist and their works.  You \ncan also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of \nemailing).\n\nIf you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope.  Merely send\ncopies to:\n\nThe OTIS Project\nc/o Ed Stastny\nPO BX 241113\nOmaha, NE 68124-1113\n\nI will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will  \nscan them.  Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back.  \nAlso include information on each image, preferably a 1-3 line \ndescription of the image that we can include in the infofile in the\ndirectory where it's finally put.  If you have preferences as to what\nthe images are to be named, include those as well.  \n \nConversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, please\ncontact me and we'll arrange things.\n\nIf you want to submit your works by disk, peachy.  Merely send a 3.5\"\ndisk to the above address (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back.\nThis is good for people who don't have direct access to encoders or FTP,\nbut do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBM\ncompatible format.  If possible, please submit image files as GIF or\nJPG.  If you can't...we can convert from most formats...we'd just rather\nnot have to.\n\nAt senders request, we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they\ncan stand.  Even if you don't have stuff to contribute, you can send\na blank disk and an SASE (or $2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to \nget a slab-o-OTIS.\n\nAs of 04/21/93, we're at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing.  \nEmail me for current archive size and directory.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDISTRIBUTION?\n\nThe images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely   \non the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is\nnot altered in any way (save to convert from one image format to\nanother).  In fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local \nbulletin boards and such.  If you could, please transport the\nappropriate text files along with the images.  \n \nIt would also be nice if you'd send me a note when you did post images\nfrom OTIS to your local bbs.  I just want to keep track of them so\nparticipants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.\n\nIt's the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as\npossible.  If you have the time, please upload a few to your favorite\nBBS system....or even just post this \"info-file\" there.  It would be\nkeen of you.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUSE?\n\nIf you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory,\nyou'll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the \nstipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or\nfull address credit).  You will either find this in the \".rm\" file for    \nthe image or series of images...or in the \"Artists\" directory under the \nArtists name.  If permission isn't explicitly given, then you'll have \nto contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, email\nme (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and I'll get in contact with the artist for \nyou, or give you their contact information.\n \nWhen you DO use permitted work, it's always courteous to let the artist\nknow about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such\ncompensation for their files.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNAMING IMAGES?\n\nPlease keep the names of your files in \"dos\" format.  That means, keep\nthe filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The way\nI usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or\nfour digit \"code\" for the series of images, plus the series number.\nThus, Leonardo DeVinci's fifth mechanical drawing would be something\nlike:\n \n\tldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETC\n\nKeeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will\nremain intact on all systems.  \n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nCREATING IMAGE FILES?\n\nWhen creating image files, be sure to at least include your name\nsomewhere on or below the picture.  This gives people a reference in\ncase they'd like to contact you.  You may also want to include a title,\naddress or other information you'd like people to know.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHMMM?!\n\nThat's about it for now.  More \"guidelines\" will be added as needed.\nYour input is expected.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project has no connection to the Church of OTIS  \n \t     (a sumerian deity) or it's followers, be they pope, priest,\n\t     or ezine administrator.  We do take sacrifices and donations\n\t     however.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project is here for the distribution of original \n \t     image files.  The files will go to the public at large.  \n\t     It's possible, as with any form of mass-media, that someone\n\t     could unscrupulously use your images for financial gain.  \n    \t     Unless you've given permission for that, it's illegal.  OTIS\n\t     takes no responsibility for this.  In simple terms, all rights\n\t     revert to the author/artist.  To leave an image on OTIS is to \n\t     give permission for it to be viewed, copied and distributed \n\t     electronically.  If you don't want your images distributed     \n\t     all-over, don't upload them.  To leave an image on OTIS is\n\t     NOT giving permission to have it used in any publication or\n\t     broadcast that incurs profit (this includes, but is not \n\t     limited to, magazines, newsletters, clip-art software,        \n\t     screen-printed clothing, etc).  You must give specific\n\t     permission for this sort of usage.  \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRemember, the operative term is \"stimulate\".  If you know of people\nthat'd be interested in this sort of thing...get them involved...kick'm\nin the booty....offer them free food...whatever...\n\n....e  (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu)\n       (ed@sunsite.unc.edu)\n\n--\nEd Stastny           | OTIS Project, END PROCESS, SOUND News and Arts \nPO BX 241113\t     | FTP: sunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS)\nOmaha, NE 68124-1113 |      141.214.4.135 (projects/otis)\n---------------------- EMail: ed@cwis.unomaha.edu, ed@sunsite.unc.edu\n"

Simple stuff,\n> like b&w logos, etc. do pretty well, while more complicated stuff goes\n> haywire.\n\n\tThe first and only thing I've ever tried to auto-trace was a piece\nof a USCG nautical chart using Adobe Illustrator 3.2.  I wanted to get the\noutline of the coast for Western Long Island Sound.  I was simultaneously\nsuprised at how good a job it did and disappointed at how poorly it did.  I\nsuspect what I gave it was a very difficult thing; not only is the coastline\nvery irregular, but overlaid on the chart are numerous sets of gridlines\n(not only lattitude and longitude, but loran grids as well).  The most\ncommon mistake it make was whenever the coastline was roughly parallel and\ntangent to a grid line, it would take off following the gridline instead of\nthe coast.  I think the best improvement would be some sort of interactive\nalgorithm that would let you step in and say \"no, dummy, you're going the\nwrong way\".\n\n\tSteve Reisberg, a friend of mine a few years back(*), did his\ndoctoral work analysing electron micrographs of filimentous phage (virii).\nA good chunk of the work was writing a program to take a digitized\nmicrograph and automatically trace the centerline of the virus particles.\nThis is essentially the same problem that Illustrator tries to solve with\nits auto-trace tool.\n\n\tIn some respects the problem Steve worked on was harder, since he\nwas trying to do quantitative analysis of the virus structure and finding a\ngood centerline was only the first step, but a step on which all future\nanalysis depended.  However, in other respects, it was an easier problem\nsince the program could be written with a lot of knowledge about what the\nvirus particles were supposed to look like, and the analysis could be\nrestricted to those particles which happend to be relatively straight,\nclean, and well imaged; you don't always have that freedom auto-tracing real\nlife images.  In any case, it gave me some insight into just how difficult\nthis problem is to solve in the general case.\n\n\t(*) Steve is no longer with us.  He and his wife disappeared while\non vacation in Hawaii a couple of years after they graduated.  Their last\nknown location was hiking in a densely wooded in a mountainous area.  While no\nbodies were ever found, they are presumed to have been the victim of some\nsort of fall or accident in the woods.\n-- \nRoy Smith <roy@nyu.edu>\nHippocrates Project, Department of Microbiology, Coles 202\nNYU School of Medicine, 550 First Avenue, New York, NY 10016\n\"This never happened to Bart Simpson.\"\n"

You could also refer to the 2nd edition of Foley & Van Dam.\n\n    On to the question.  The simple answer is that you just keep adding up\nall the contributions and then clamping at the maximum intensity.  For\nexample, if your intensity values range from 0.0 to 1.0, then keep adding up\nand clamp the resultant values to 1.0 (you might have to clamp the lower\nbound to 0.0 if you have dark bulbs, but that's another issue =^).  So, you\nget some illumination equation like this:\n\n        I = Lambient + Ldiffuse(light[n]) + Lreflected + Ltransparent\n\n    The contribution due to reflection is just summed with the light\nintensity, as is the light due to transparency.  Now, a slightly less\nhand-waving illumination equation is this:\n\n        I = KaLa + KdLd(light[n]) + KrLr + KtLt\n\n    That is, each component of the illumination equation is governed by the\nmaterial constants Ka, Kd, Kr and Kt.  So the maximum you can get from\ntransparency for a given object, for example, might be [0.4, 0.1, 0.5] for a\npurple-colored glass object.\n\n    Hopefully this answers your question.  I'll forward my \"illumination\nequation sermon\" to you also.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\nSteve Hollasch                                   Kubota Pacific Computer, Inc.\nhollasch@kpc.com                                 Santa Clara, California\n"

Added\n  some stuff for scientific graphs, i.e. log axes, free scalable axes,\n  XY-lineplots and some more, and re-added plotter callbacks from V4, e.g.\n  to request the current pointer position, or to cut off a rectangle from the\n  plotting area for zooming-in. Version V6.0 has a log of bugs fixed and a\n  log of improvements against V6-beta. Additionally I did some other\n  changes/extensions, besides \n  \n  -     Origin and frame lines for axes.\n  -     Subgrid lines on subtic positions.\n  -     Line plots in different line types (lines, points, lines+points,\n   impulses, lines+impulses, steps, bars), line styles (solid, dotted,\n   dashed, dot-dashed) and marker types for data points.\n  -     Legend at the right or left hand side of the plot.\n  -     Optional drawing to a pixmap instead of a window.\n  -     Layout callback for aligning axis positions when using\n   multiple plotters in one application.\n  \n  Available at export.lcs.mit.edu, directory contrib/plotter\n\nSciPlot\n-------\n  SciPlot is a scientific 2D plotting and manipulation program. \n  For the NeXT (requires NeXTStep 3.0), and it's shareware.\n\n  Features:\n  ASCII import and export;  EPS export; copy, cut, paste with data buffer;\n  free number of data points, data buffer, and document window;\n  selective open and save ; plotting in many styles; automatic legend;\n  subviews; linear and logarithmic axes; two different axes; text and graphic;\n  color support; zoom; normalizing and moving; axis conversions;\n  free hand data manipulations (cut, edit, move, etc.); data editor; sorting\n  of data; absolute,relative, and free defined error bars;\n  calculating with buffers (+, -, *, / ); background subtractions\n  (linear,shirley,tougaard, bezier); integration and relative integration;\n  fitting of one or more free defined functions; linear regression;\n  calculations (+, -, *, /, sin, cos, log, etc.); function generator;\n  spline interpolation; least square smooth and FFT smooth; differentiation;\n  FFT; ESCA calculations and database; .. and something more \n\n  You can find it on:\n  ftp.cs.tu-berlin.de [130.149.17.7] : /pub/NeXT/science/SciPlot3.1.tar.Z\n\n  Author:\n  Michael Wesemann\n  Scillerstr. 73,1000 Berlin 12, Germany   \n  mike@fiasko.rz-berlin.mpg.de\n\nPLPLOT\n------\n  PLPLOT is a scientific plotting package for many systems, small (micro)\n  and large (super) alike.  Despite its small size and quickness,\n  it has enough power to satisfy most users, including:\n  standard x-y plots, semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots,\n  mesh plots, bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs (of the same or\n  different sizes) may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each\n  graph.  Different line styles, widths and colors are supported.  A virtually\n  infinite number of distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are\n  almost 1000 characters in the extended character set.  This includes four\n  different fonts, the Greek alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and\n  other symbols.  The fonts can be scaled to any size for various effects.\n  Many different output device drivers are available (system dependent),\n  including a portable metafile format and renderer.\n  \n  Freely available (but copyrighted) via anonymous FTP on\n  hagar.ph.utexas.edu, directory pub/plplot\n  \n  At present (v. 4.13), PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems:\n  \n  Unix:   SunOS, A/IX, HP-UX, Unicos, DG/UX, Ultrix\n  Other platforms: VMS, Amiga/Exec, MS-DOS, OS/2, NeXT\n  \n  Authors: Many.

Image analysis software - Image processing and display\n==========================================================\n\nPC and Mac-based tools (multi-platform software)\n======================\n\nIMDISP\n------\n  IMDISP Written at JPL and other NASA sites. Can do simple display,\n  enhancing, smoothing and so on. Works with the FITS and VICAR/PDS\n  data formats of NASA. Can read TIFF images, if you know their dimensions\n  [PC and Macs]\n\nLabVIEW 2\n---------\n  LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools. It provides a\n  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the\n  \"program\" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.\n  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a\n  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the\n  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and\n  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any\n  Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real\n  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual\n  instrument.\n\n  National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)\n  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time\n  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for\n  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The\n  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block\n  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming\n  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:\n  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters\n  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C\n  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual\n  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.\n\n  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an\n  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level\n  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level\n  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.\n\n  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has\n  utility functions for memory management data communications and\n  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for\n  the development of custom code.)\n\nUltimage Concept VI\n-------------------\n  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual\n  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end\n  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.\n  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory\n  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,\n  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,\n  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.\n\n  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further\n  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of\n  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and\n  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical\n  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and\n  characterization.\n\n  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel\n  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and\n  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can\n  be imported.\n\n  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial\n  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic\n  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological\n  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole\n  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.\n  Quantitative analysis provides for objects' detection, measurement, and\n  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of\n  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and\n  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The\n  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom\n  modules.\n\n  A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity\n  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can\n  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight\n  arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging\n  sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are\n  13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local\n  intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.\n  The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as\n  either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)\n  data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening\n  and defining objects or for removing artifacts.\n\n  The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even\n  hole filling.\n\n  The program's quantitative analysis measurements include: area,\n  perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.\n\n  GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494\n  707-579-1733\n\nIPLab Spectrum\n--------------\n  IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the\n  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by\n  Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user\n  tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far\n  too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool\n  supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a\n  movie command for cycling through windows.\n\n\nMacintosh-based tools\n=====================\n\nNCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more\n---------------------------------\n  NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the\n  Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results\n  from numerical modelling calculations.  These applications,\n  documentation, and source code are available for anonymous ftp from\n  ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu. Commercial versions of the NCSA programs have been\n  developed by Spyglass.\n\n  Spyglass, Inc. 701 Devonshire Drive Champaign, IL  61820 (217) 355-6000\n  fax: 217 355 8925\n\nNIH IMAGE\n---------\n  Available at alw.nih.gov (128.231.128.7) or (preferably)\n  zippy.nimh.nih.gov [128.231.98.32], directory:/pub/image.\n  It has painting and image manipulation tools, a macro language,\n  tools for measuring areas, distances and angles, and for counting\n  things. Using a frame grabber card, it can record sequences of\n  images to be played back as a movie. It can invoke user-defined\n  convolution matrix filters, such as Gaussian. It can import raw\n  data in tab-delimited ASCII, or as 1 or 2-byte quantities. It also\n  does histograms and even 3-D plots. It is limited to 8-bits/pixel,\n  though the 8 bits map into a color lookup table. It runs on any Mac\n  that has a 256-color screen and a FPU (or get the NonFPU version\n  from zippy.nimh.nih.gov)\n\nPhotoMac\n--------\n  Data Translation, Inc. 100 Locke Dr. Marlboro, MA 01752 508-481-3700\n\nPhotoPress\n----------\n  Blue Solutions 3039 Marigold Place Thousand Oaks, CA 91360 805-492-9973\n\nPixelTools and TCL-Image\n------------------------\n  \"Complete family of PixelTools (hardware accelerator and applications\n  software) for scientific image processing and analysis.  Video-rate\n  capture, display, processing, and analysis of high-resolution\n  monochromatic and color images.  Includes C source code.\"\n\nTCL-Image:\n  \"Software package for scientific, quantitative image processing and\n  analysis. It provides a complete language for the capture, enhancement,\n  and extraction of quantitative information from gray-scale images.\n  TCL_Image has over 200 functions for image processing, and contains the\n  other elements needed in a full programming language for algorithm\n  development -- variables and control structures.  It is easily\n  extensible through \"script\" (or indirect command) files. These script\n  files are simply text files that contain TCL-Image commands.  They are\n  executed as normal commands and include the ability to pass parameters.\n  The direct capture of video images is supported via popular frame\n  grabber boards.  TCL-Image comes with the I-View utility that provides\n  conversion between common image file types, such as PICT2 and TIFF.\"\n\n  Perceptics 725 Pellissippi Parkway Knoxville, TN 37933 615-966-9200\n\nSatellite Image Workshop\n------------------------\n  It comes with a number of satellite pictures (raw data) and does all\n  sorts of image enhancing on it. You'll need at least a Mac II with co-\n  processor; a 256 color display and a large harddisk. The program doesn't\n  run under system 7.x.ATE1 V1\n\n  In the documentation the contact address is given as:  Liz Smith, Jet\n  Propulsion Laboratory, MS 300-323, 4800 Oak Grove Dr,.Pasadena, CA 91109\n  (818) 354-6980\n\nVisualization Workbench\n-----------------------\n  \"An electronic imaging software system that performs interactive image\n  analysis and scientific 2D and 3D plotting.\"\n\n  Paragon Imagine 171 Lincoln St. Lowell, MA 01852 508-441-2112\n\nAdobe Photoshop\n---------------\n\n  The tool supports Rtrue colorS with 24-bit images or 256 levels of grey\n  scale.  Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with\n  various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS\n  applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.\n  Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted\n  selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For\n  example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from\n  being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,\n  allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include\n  control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation\n  modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to\n  various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,\n  blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.\n\n  For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard\n  algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,\n  availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe\n  Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,\n  EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,\n  PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..\n\n  Adobe Systems, Inc. 1585 Charlestown Road PO Box 7900 Mountain View, CA\n  94039-7900 415-961-4400\n\nColorStudio and ImageStudio\n---------------------------\n  ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has\n  more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and\n  therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to\n  accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The\n  application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can\n  easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.  The program provides a\n  variety of powerful selection tools including the \"auto selection tool\"\n  which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close\n  hues, color range and mask.\n\nImageStudio: Don't know...\n\n  Letraset USA 40 Eisenhower Drive Paramus, NJ 07653 201-845-6100\n\nDapple Systems\n--------------\n  \"High resolution image analysis software provides processing tools to\n  work with multiple images, enhance and edit, and measure a variety of\n  global or feature parameters, and interpret the data.\"\n\n  Dapple Systems, 355 W. Olive Ave, #100 Sunnyvale, CA 94086 408-733-3283\n\nDigital Darkroom\n----------------\n  The latest release of Digital Darkroom has five new selection and\n  editing tools for enhancing images. One such feature allows the user to\n  select part of an image simply by \"painting\" it. A new polyline\n  selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide\n  selections.  A brush lets the operator \"paint\" with a selected portion\n  of the image. Note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool.\n  This tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale\n  images only.  It should be noted that Digital Darkroom is not as\n  powerful as either Adobe Photoshop or ColorStudio.\n\n  Silicon Beach Software 9770 Carroll Ctr. Rd., Suite J San Diego, CA\n  92126 619-695-6956\n\nDimple\n------\n  It  is compatible with system 6.05 and system 7.0 , requires Mac LC or\n  II series with 256 colours, with a recommended min of 6Mb of ram. It has\n  the capability of reading Erdas files. Functions include; image\n  enhancement, 3D and contour plots, image statistics, supervised and\n  unsupervised classification, PCA and other image transformations.

The tool has over 80 mathematical filter\n  variations: \"Laplacian, medium noise filter\", etc.  Files can be saved\n  as either TIFF, PICT, EPSF or text (however EPSF files can't be imported).\n\n  MicroFrontier 7650 Hickman Road Des Moines, IA  50322 515-270-8109\n\nImage Analyst\n-------------\n  An image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative\n  data from video images.  Image Analyst lets users configure\n  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the\n  necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such\n  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video\n  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in\n  radiographs.\n\n  Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video\n  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of\n  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine\n  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature\n  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst\n  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or\n  a disk-stored image.\n\n  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user\n  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.\n  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically\n  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.\n  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and\n  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and\n  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR\n  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.\n\n  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence\n  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user\n  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)\n  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the\n  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,\n  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and\n  other positions automatically.

Software distributed by 9-track, Exabyte, DAT,\n  or (non-anonymous) internet ftp.  Documentation (PostScript mostly)\n  available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103),\n  directory pub/aips and pub/aips/TEXT/PUBL.  Installation requires building\n  the system and thus a Fortran and C compiler.\n     This package can read and write FITS data (see sci.astro.fits), and is\n  primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of Radio Astronomy\n  data from radio telescopes, particularly the Very Large Array (VLA), a\n  synthesis instrument.  It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything\n  from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy.\n  There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based\n  graphics tool built into AIPS.  The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware\n  functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and\n  can do image arithmetic, etc.\n    The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules, and is\n  available for Suns, IBM RS/6000, Dec/Ultrix, Convex, Cray (Unicos), and\n  Alliant with support planned for HP-9000/7xx, Solaris 2.1, and maybe SGI.\n     There is currently a project - \"AIPS++\" - underway to rewrite the\n  algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting, using C++ and an\n  object oriented approach.  Whereas AIPS is proprietary code (licensed for\n  free to non-profit institutions) owner by NRAO and the NSF, AIPS++ will be\n  in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with\n  contributions from the US, Canada, England, the Netherlands, India, and\n  Australia to name a few. \n\nLABOimage\n---------\n  (version 4.0 is out for X11) It's written in C, and currently\n  runs on Sun 3/xxx, Sun 4/xxx (OS3.5, 4.0 and 4.0.3) under SunView.\n  The expert system for image segmentation is written in Allegro Common Lisp.\n  It was used on the following domains: computer science (image analysis), \n  medicine, biology, physics.

All functions can be easily accessed via the\n  DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image\n  processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that\n  complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of\n  modules.\n\n  Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and\n  supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and\n  Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and\n  effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and\n  ratioing.\n\n  Host Configuration Requirements\n\n  Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more\n  computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.\n  DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer's environments. Using\n  the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific\n  applications programs.\n\n  Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick\n  enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,\n  colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be\n  interactively driven through this control.\n\n  A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of\n  image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of\n  coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential\n  for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be\n  added to further enhance referenced imagery.\n\n  The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels\n  to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help\n  required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The\n  purchase price includes all functionality required for professional\n  processing of remote sensed data.\n\n  For further information, please contact:\n\n  The Business Manager, CLOUGH Engineering Group Systems Division, 627\n  Chapel Street, South Yarra, Australia 3141.

Supports 24-bit display\"\n\nHIPS\n----\n(Human   Information   Processing Laboratory's Image Processing System)\n\n  Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image\n  processing which has been used for basically all the usual image\n  processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil\n  exploration, etc.).  It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of\n  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has\n  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well\n  as a huge user-contributed library.\n\n  Feature description\n\n  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide\n  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,\n  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images\n  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.\n\n  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image\n  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform\n  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital\n  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image\n  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs\n  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task\n  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows\n  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users\n  become effective using HIPS on their first day.\n\n  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in\n  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been\n  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines\n  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and\n  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX\n  ``filters''.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual\n  pages, and on-line documentation.\n\n  Host Configuration Requirements\n\n  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents\n  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing\n  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating\n  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation\n  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.\n  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and\n  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.\n  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and\n  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and\n  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a\n  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun\n  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X\n  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an\n  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS\n  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with\n  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-\n  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices\n  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.\n\n  Availability\n\n  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an\n  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It\n  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS\n  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or\n  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of\n  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.\n\n  Michael Landy SharpImage Software P.O.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]\n\n  MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives\n  workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in\n  256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional\n  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS\n  formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary\n  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-\n  dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer\n  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the\n  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision\n  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in\n  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire\n  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize\n  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data\n  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value\n  value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time\n  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of\n  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of\n  grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other \n  palettes can be generated.\n\n\nSupported functions include such niceties as the following:\n\no  image & image: + - / * interpolation\no  image & constant: + - / *\no  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,\n   byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short.\no  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or\n   without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section.\no  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,\n   line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp\n   masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.

ACCESS.bus is a serial protocol that \nuses simple, low-cost I2C technology to link multiple devices to \na single PC port.  Peripheral devices such as keyboards or \nkeypads, locators (Mice, Trackballs, Joysticks), printers, VR \ngloves, digitizers, sensors, actuators or data transmitters and \nothers can be easily daisy chained to the host PC.  Applications \nsuch as CAD/CAM, Data Acquisition, Simulation, Virtual Reality, \nMultiple-Player/Single PC Games, Education and many, many more \ncan now take advantage of ACCESS.bus, the technology that puts \nPlug and Play on every PC.\n\nThe ACCESS.bus offers advantages to end-users and developers of \nsystems and peripherals.  Multiple devices connect to the host \ncomputer with only one port.  Common communication methods for a \nnumber of device types lead to simplified hardware and software \ndevelopment.  As an open standard, ACCESS.bus enables cross-\nplatform use of the same device.\n\nACCESS.bus TECHNOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION:\n=====================================\n\nACCESS.bus technology is an open specification, enabling anyone \nto implement it on host systems or in peripheral devices without \nfee or royalty.\nACCESS.bus has a bus topology architecture.  That is, a single \nhost can accommodate up to 125 peripheral devices.  ACCESS.bus \ndata rate is 100 Kbits/sec.\n\nACCESS.bus Physical Layer\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nACCESS.bus is a serial bus architecture, based on I2C hardware \nprotocol, with one data line and one clock line.\nStandard low-cost I2C microcontrollers handle bit-level \nhandshaking, including automatic arbitration and clock \nsynchronization.  \n\nACCESS.bus Software Protocols\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nThe ACCESS.bus communication protocol is composed of three \nlevels: I2C Protocol, Base Protocol, and Application Protocol.\n\nI2C PROTOCOL: This simple and efficient protocol defines \narbitration among contending masters without losing data.  I2C \nprovides for cooperative synchronization of bus partners with \ndifferent clock rates.  Bus transactions include addressing, \nframing of bits into bytes, and byte acknowledgment by the \nreceiver.  \n\nBASE PROTOCOL: Establishes the asymmetrical interconnect between \na host computer and multiple peripherals.  The host becomes the \nACCESS.bus manager.  The Base Protocol defines the format of an \nACCESS.bus message envelope, which is an I2C bus transaction with \nadditional semantics, including checksum.\nUnique features of the Base Protocol are auto-addressing and hot \nplugging.  Auto-addressing assigns devices with unique bus \naddresses, without the need for setting jumpers or switches.  Hot \nplugging is the ability to attach and detach devices while the \nsystem is running, without rebooting.\n\nAPPLICATION PROTOCOL: This is the highest level of the ACCESS.bus \nprotocol which defines message semantics specific to particular \ntypes of devices.  Each type requires a different Application \nProtocol.  Three broad device types have been identified: \nkeyboards, locators, and text devices.\n\nACCESS.bus support on the PC\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nAll three levels of the ACCESS.bus protocol are supported on the \nPC.  An add-on card implements the physical layer and uses the \nbase protocol to communicate with physical ACCESS.bus devices.  \nAn ACCESS.bus Manager - TSR under DOS and a DLL under Windows 3.1 \n- controls the operation of the physical layer and interacts with \nthe ACCESS.bus device drivers.  Drivers are available for \nmultiple ACCESS.bus keyboards, locators and printers for DOS and \nWindows 3.1.  Also available are C language source code examples \nof the interface from applications to the device drivers.\n\n\nTo Contact ABIG (the ACCESS.bus Industry Group):\n------------------------------------------------\nPostal Address:\n370 Altair Way, Suite 215, Sunnyvale, CA 94086\nInternet Email:  abig@netcom.com\nFax: (408) 991-3773\nVoice: (408) 991-3517\n\n"

JPEG is designed for compressing either\nfull-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes.\nIt does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\ndrawings.\n\nJPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\nhandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\nof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\nrespectively.\n\nJPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't\nquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\nof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\nthe fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details\nof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\nbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\nsmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\ninvisible to the eye.\n\nA useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\nadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\noff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\nfiles if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\narchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\naren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\ncan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\n\n\n[2]  Why use JPEG?\n\nThere are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\n24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\n\nMaking image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\nnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\n2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\ndisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\nsize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\n\nIf your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to\nconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\nwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\nthan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\nJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\nstore or transmit an image more cheaply.\n\nIt's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\ntime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\nextra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\n\nThe other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\nposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel\n(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\nonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\nto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\nblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\nin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\npeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\nmore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\n\n\n[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\n\nJPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\nGIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\nthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\ngray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\nsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display\nhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\n\nGIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\nsuch as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\nthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\nby GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\nintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\n(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\nshould be avoided in JPEG files.)\n\nJPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\nadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\ncome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\nsort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\noften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\nparticularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high.\nIf you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.\n\nComputer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\nscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\nsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\nThe same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\n\nPlain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\nYou need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\nimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\nof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\n\nIf you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\nshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\n(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\napplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\na GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\ncan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\nconverting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself.\nIf you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\nprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not\nconvert well.\n\n\n[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?\n\nPretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have\nhandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three\nfiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG\nsoftware described in section 6B.\n\nFile\t   Size in bytes\t\tComments\n\nship.ppm\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits\n\t\t\t or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)\nship.ppm.Z\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress\n\t\t\t compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.\n\t\t\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.\nship.gif\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif\n\t\t\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color\n\t\t\t info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)\n\nship.jpg95\t 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)\n\t\t\t This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,\n\t\t\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.\nship.jpg75\t  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)\n\t\t\t You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this\n\t\t\t from the original, even with both on-screen at once.\nship.jpg50\t  38406  cjpeg -Q 50\n\t\t\t This has slight defects; if you know what to look\n\t\t\t for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing\n\t\t\t the original.  Still as good image quality as many\n\t\t\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.\nship.jpg25\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25\n\t\t\t JPEG's characteristic \"blockiness\" becomes apparent\n\t\t\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).\n\t\t\t Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were\n\t\t\t of poorer image quality than this.\nship.jpg5o\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)\n\t\t\t Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or\n\t\t\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:\n\t\t\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !\n\nIn this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller\nthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the\nGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical\nratio for real-world scenes.\n\n\n[5]  What are good \"quality\" settings for JPEG?\n\nMost JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by\nselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about\nthe meaning of these settings.  \"Quality 95\" does NOT mean \"keep 95% of the\ninformation\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;\nit's not a percentage of anything.\n\nThe name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting\n(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from\nthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one\nobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.\n\nThe default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This\nsetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a\ntypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for\nexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a\nfile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.\n\nIf the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\ngo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you\nmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.\nThe second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.\nThe default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to\n95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).\n\nIf you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are\nprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is\nabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \"op art\".\n\n(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG\nsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other\nJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different\nquality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just\n\"high\"/\"medium\"/\"low\"-style choices.)\n\n\n[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?\n\nMost of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.\nIf you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \"How to find sources\".\n(If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the\nsame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can\nget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\n\"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\" in the body.  The \"Anonymous FTP\nList FAQ\" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in\nthe news.answers archive.\n\nNOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple\nmonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.\n\n\n[6A]  If you are looking for \"canned\" software, viewers, etc:\n\nThe first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one\nkind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check out\nthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this\nlist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over\nInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.\n\nX Windows:\n\nXV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other\nimage formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image\nmanipulations.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12),\nfile contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support\nfor 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new\nand still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding\nedge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that\nversion 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll get\nonly 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works\nfine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a\nglitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the \"save at normal size\" checkbox\nwhen saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.\n\nAnother good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package,\nalso available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.\nThis package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The\nImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped\ndisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the\nbasic free JPEG software.\n\nBoth of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple\nimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest\nrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,\nfile contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,\nsaid by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.\n(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current\nxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4\ndecoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next\nxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said\nto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.\n\n\nMS-DOS:\n\nThis covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.\n\nOne good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.\nThe current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca\n(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic\nviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is\nnot flashy, but it's functional.\n\nAnother freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  The\ncurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\nbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU\nand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and\nOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no\nbigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit\non the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).\nYou may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it\nslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a\nbit tricky; read the directions carefully!\n\nA shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to\ninstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is\nalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---\nmore keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a\nlittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than\nscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both\nare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.\nRequires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip\nor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in\nVESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains\nthat the driver is missing.)\n\nA second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around\nthe net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it.\nThe current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.\nThe author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly\nand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.\n\nThe well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest\nrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good:\nit's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is\npoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a\ngood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.\n\nDue to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these\nviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any*\nof them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs\nto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you\nhave hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try to\nfind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right\nthing with hi-color displays.)\n\nThe Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20\nand mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or\njpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS\ncompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will\nconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.\n\nHandmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.\nThese are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in\nparticular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major\nadvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary\nJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format\nfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version\n2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.\nNOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is\nnot readable on non-PC platforms.\n\nHandmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation\npackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI\nformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.\nA demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.\n\nNOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs\nis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20\nruns a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document\nrefers to directory (eg) \"msdos/graphics\" at Simtel20, that really means\n\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should\nexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several\nInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;\nmost FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA\nmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files\nin (eg) \"/pub/msdos/graphics\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can\nretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in\ncomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,\nconsult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.\n\nMicrosoft Windows:\n\nThere are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.\n(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,\ndue to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion\nprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)\n\nThe newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0\nis available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.\nRequires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills\nviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it\ndecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.\nBut it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...\n\nJView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the\ndecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEG\nfiles, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful\nfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's\nan excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from\nftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.\n(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,\nincluding wuarchive.wustl.edu.)\n\nWinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;\nit can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.\nIt has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and\nslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror\nsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow\n286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version,\nwhich is roughly 25% faster.)\n\nColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising\ncontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it\nhas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the\ncurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file\npub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will\nbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)\n\nDVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen\nmode, not in a window.\n\nOS/2:\n\nThe following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).\nNote: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator\nis not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip\n    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.\n/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip\n    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip\n    Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.\n    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip\n    PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows\n    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip\n    PMView 0.85: JPEG/GIF/BMP/Targa/PCX viewer.  GIF viewing very fast,\n    JPEG viewing roughly the same speed as the above two programs.  Has\n    image manipulation & slideshow functions.  Shareware, $20.\n\nMacintosh:\n\nMost Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part of\nthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.\nTo use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running\nSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also install\nthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get\nQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.\n(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0\nin several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and\nconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,\nsome applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)\n\nMac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is\nnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for\ndetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.\nMost of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.\n\nThe first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images\nthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can\nconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big\nimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\n(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and\nQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color\nimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can\nview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it's\nthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a\ntypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down\nto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other\nviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people\nlike this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is very\nwell thought out.\n\nGIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and\nPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest\nversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\n/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.\nGIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but\nit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion\ncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of\nplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can\nload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if\nyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.)\nNote: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try\nconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.\n\nJPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is\navailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.\nThis will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.\nYou can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.\n\nPrevious versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF\nconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this\nprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.\n\nApple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and\nGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie\nfrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.\nRequires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's\nreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.\nSome of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces\nrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,\nand it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an\nunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not\nintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called\nPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash\nit, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much\ncleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that\nPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)\n\nStorm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.\nThis rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but\nit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on\nolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can't\nuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\n/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a\ndownloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.\n\nIf your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),\nGIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you\ndon't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.\n\nMore and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not\nall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version\n2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG\nplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded\nJPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.\n\nAmiga:\n\n(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this\narchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good\nchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)\n\nHamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a\ngeneral image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read\nseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version\nis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\namiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger\nthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.\n\nRend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,\nand GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even\ncapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The\ncurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror\nsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is\nsupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under\nAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)\n\nViewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,\navailable from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\namiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.\n\nIf you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages\nthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24\nand Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and\nImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,\neffects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are\ndistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),\nfrom ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation\nsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another\nwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.\n\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file\nAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.\n\nThe Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many\nbased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks\nto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without\nso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \"AugJPEG\", \"NewAmyJPEG\",\n\"VJPEG\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,\nanything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space\nit's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.\n\nAtari ST:\n\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.\nThese programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.\n\nFor monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level\ngrayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Available\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.\n\nI have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for\nAtaris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.\n\nAcorn Archimedes:\n\n!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view\nJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,\nalthough this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.\n\nRecent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle\nJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be\nfound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by\nregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,\nThe Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).\n\nThere's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write\nfunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image\nformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not\nnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,\nCambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.\n\nNeXT:\n\nImageViewer is a PD utility that displays images and can do some format\nconversions.  The current version reads JPEG but does not write it.\nImageViewer is available from the standard NeXT archives at\nsonata.cc.purdue.edu and cs.orst.edu, somewhere in /pub/next (both are\ncurrently being re-organized, so it's hard to point to specific\nsub-directories).  Note that there is an older version floating around that\ndoes not support JPEG.\n\n\nPortable software for almost any system:\n\nIf none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free\nJPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program.\nIf your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a\ndisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa\nor PPM 24-bit image files.\n\nThere are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every\nday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find\nthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,\npurchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether\nthe product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can\nhandle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are\nnot and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.\n\n\n[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:\n\nFree, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent\nJPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,\ndocumentation, and some small test files is available from several places.\nThe \"official\" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9\nor 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release\nis jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget to\nretrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.\nIf you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may\nprefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\nabove), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on\nCompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.\nIf you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest\ncomp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.\n(If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ\narticle \"How to find sources\", referred to at the top of section 6.)\n\nThe free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG \"JFIF\" format and image\nfiles in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.\nThe core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other\nprograms, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have\ntested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.\n\nWe have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.\nCompanies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.\nWe do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in\nproduct literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).\nWe hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with\nanything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.\n\nThe Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to\ncontribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.\n\n\n[7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?\n\nMost people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware.\nTypical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display\n256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the\ncomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative\ncolors.  This process is called \"color quantization\".  (This is something\nof a misnomer, \"color selection\" would be a better term.  We're stuck with\nthe standard usage though.)\n\nClearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most\nimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact\non the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at\nthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).\n\nSince JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display\non 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for\n*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what\ncomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.\nThis happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little\ndifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably\ncome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \"smeared\"\ninto a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to\ndisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image\nsource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.\n\n(Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about\nthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count\nthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you\ndifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see\nposted images described as \"256-color JPEG\".  This tells me that the poster\n(a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.\nJPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but\nnumber of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)\n\nOn the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to\n256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its\npalette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.)\nFor purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the\nsender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to.\nThis is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender's\nquantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than\nwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer\nimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.\nFurthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization\nalgorithm, you're out of luck.\n\nFor this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality\nfor all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware.\nJPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display\nhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future\nimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in\nthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG\nimages you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what was\nsent.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather\nshoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA\ndisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you\nneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color\nquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it's\nalso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use\nhigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in\nnormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be\ndisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average\nGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!\n\nFinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display\nhardware already: 15-bit \"hi-color\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on\nworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already\nobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their\ndisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.\nThus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images\nin a machine-independent fashion.\n\n\n[8]  How does JPEG work?\n\nThe buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine\ntransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy\ncoding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say more\nthan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.\nThis is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in\nusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.\n\n\n[9]  What about lossless JPEG?\n\nThere's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did\ndefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the\nfinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this\nlossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG\nalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few\nimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.\n\nSaying \"-Q 100\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.\nWhat it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient\nquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the\ncolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say\n\"-sample 1x1\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial\nJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)\n\nEven with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG\nalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in\nvarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel\nvalue; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,\nbut it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.\n\nAt this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps\nhalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG\nprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees\nbit-for-bit accuracy.\n\nIf you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less\nthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the\nJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG\nlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with\n6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a\nHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.\n\n\n[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?\n\nStrictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;\nit does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was\nprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international\nstandards organizations.\n\nSince we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on\na common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of\nofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to\n\"do their own thing\", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with\nanybody else's.\n\nThe closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work\nthat's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined\ntwo JPEG-based file formats:\n  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \"low-end\" format that transports\n    pixels and not much else.\n  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is\n    a \"high-end\" format that will let you record just about everything you\n    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is\n    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,\n    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different\n    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the\n    mix will do anything to improve this situation.\nBoth of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors\nof JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial\nproducts will adhere to one or both standards.\n\nI believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in\npicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the\nTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still\nunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well\ndefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \"lowest common\ndenominator\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.\n\nA particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime\nsoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped\ninside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and\nQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are\navailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor\nthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF\nby hand; see section 11 for details.\n\nAnother particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and\nImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF\nformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by\nHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be\nused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This\napplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF\nformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format\nfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)\n\n\n[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?\n\nIf you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likely\nto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell\nwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:\n\n1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,\n    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.\n\n2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a\n    \"raw JPEG\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---\n    it's worth a try, anyway.\n\n3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI\n    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they\n    won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.\n\n4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred\n    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off\n    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.\n\n5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are\n    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.\n    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),\n    try stripping off everything before that.\n\nIn uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is\n\n\t\"begin\" line\n\tM_]C_X ...\n\nwhereas uuencoded HSI files will start with\n\n\t\"begin\" line\n\tM:'-I ...\n\nIf you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of\ndownloading non-JFIF files.\n\n\n[12]  What about arithmetic coding?\n\nThe JPEG spec defines two different \"back end\" modules for the final output\nof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.\nThe choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually\nproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding\nproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the\nfile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)\n\nUnfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the\nJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.\nThus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses\nfrom these companies.  (The \"fair use\" doctrine allows people to implement\nand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious\nat best.)\n\nAt least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about\narithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the\npotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*\nbe used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.\n\nThere is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the\nfuture.  Stay tuned for further details.\n\n\n[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?\n\nIt would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could\ndecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it\nwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.\nUnfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered\nimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the\nfirst time around.\n\nThe next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress\nit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an\nidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current\nfree JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff\nerror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually\ndegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation\noutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)\nOne of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can\nbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.\n\nIn any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that\ncompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original\nquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes\nas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.\n(If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move.\nIf you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but\nthat's a mighty limited capability!)\n\nThe bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and\ntransmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate\nformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format\n(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are\nready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot\nof compression/decompression time this way :-).\n\n\n[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?\n\nAs stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\nconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original\nfull-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from\nthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,\nhere are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum\nloss of quality.\n\nThe first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to\nmake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;\nthat will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\nsetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in\nsection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors\ndon't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality\nwill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)\n\nExperience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best\ncandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer\nthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.\nDon't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don't\nexpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created\ndirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have\nto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through\nJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,\nnot 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).\n\nMany people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color\nborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of\nstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp\nborder boundary can create visible artifacts (\"ghost\" edges).  Do yourself\na favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows\nsystem, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless\nway to do this.)\n\ncjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but\nfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\nimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher\nQ setting may not be necessary.)\n\nColor GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \"dithered\" to fool\nyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.\nIf you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of\nsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels\ntogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The\ntrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency\ncolor noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG\nfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\ngotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).\nTo get around this, you want to \"smooth\" the GIF image before compression.\nSmoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that\nyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid\ncolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will\noften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of\nthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image\nthan you'd get without smoothing.\n\nWith the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing\ncapability is built in.  Try \"-smooth 10\" or so when converting GIFs.\nValues of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed\ndithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular\nfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong\nsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur\nthe output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processing\nwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as\npnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother is\na LOT faster than pnmconvol...\n\nThe upshot of all this is that \"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\" is probably a\ngood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the\nimage, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.\n\n\n---------------------\n\nFor more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in\nparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.\n\n-- \n\t\t\ttom lane\n\t\t\torganizer, Independent JPEG Group\nInternet: tgl@cs.cmu.edu\tBITNET: tgl%cs.cmu.edu@carnegie\n"

Windows\n> crashed on\n>all of the time (and from what I have read in PC Mag, this is not\n> the exception)\n\n\n\tI'd say that the massive crash problems are exceedingly rare.\n\tWindows _itself_ almost never crashes, but it can be crashed by\n\tan errant application (My personal favorite?  Any one of the Corel\n\t3.0 programs).  On the other hand, I have had OS/2 crash randomly\n\ta number of times, mostly just running it's own applications.\n\n\tFor instance.  Today I discovered a new one.  While I was downloading\n\twith Procomm Plus For Windows (running seamless with the standard\n\tVGA drivers on a run-o' da mill VGA card--640x480), I decided that\n\tI wanted to edit a copy of a quote that I wanted to add to my \n\t.finger.  But since I've learned not to really trust seamless, \n\tI fired up a full screen WinOS/23.1 session.  Whoops, the download\n\tfinished while WinOS/2 was loading.  It had _just_ gotten\n\tthe pointer up, so I hit alt-escape to get back t the desktop\n\t(I have a lot of fonts, so loading takes a good long while).\n\t\n\tBlam.  Screen trashed, Procomm hangs up.  Hm.  Well, I can sorta\n\tsee the mouse, so I clicked on the minimized WINOS/2 session \n\tand got back my fullscreen Windows session (but the color were\n\toff--red and green and yellow and brown instead of blues and greys).\n\tSo I closed this, and got back to the desktop (now fully restored).\n\n\tPP+ was still sitting, window open, but it was no longer \n\t\"connected\" to the com port--so I exited it (the normal way--\n\tit told me I was still online and it would hang up, though it\n\twas _already_ hung up).  Hm.  Well, load anothe--no, bad idea. \n\tShutdown and reboot.\n\n\tOk, refresh first.. Now, shutdown.  Yes, everything is closed...\n\n\tHm.  Nothing seems to be happening.  Let's see.. Ah, the \n\twindows list still comes up.  OK, let's try shutdown again.\n\n\tNo go.  Huh.\n\n\tAlright, wait 60 seconds to see if it's just running slow.\n\n\tHmm.  Still seems to be running OS/2.  Try shutdown again.\n\tNothing.  Oh well.  Reboot.  Enjoy the checkdisk time.\n  \n\tIn this case, a part of the OS crashed not only itself, but\n\tOS/2 entirely (which isn't even smart enough to tell when it;s\n\tbeen compromised, I guess).  In everyday (specifically _today_)\n\tuse.\n\n\n> OS/2 gives each windows app a VDM and they can't touch each other or\n>(generally) anything they aren't supposed to have.\n\n\n\tThat's the idea, anyway.  In truth, when a program crashes on \n\tOS/2, it will bring the system down with it.  The programs that\n\twould just GPF under Windows do the same under OS/2, but programs\n\tthat are fine under DOS and Windows bring OS/2 screaming to a halt,\n\ttask protection or no.  \n\n\tFor instance, I'm still wondering why print preview in a windowed\n\tWP 5.1 (DOS) locks up my system.  It works fine under DOS or even in\n\ta dos box under Windows 3.1.  (Admittedly, it doesn't crash if I run\n\tWP51 full screen, but the first time this bug big me, it bit hard).\n\n\n\n>  If windows works for you,\n>then great.  Maybe this is why some people don't see why OS/2 is the OS of \n>choice.  If windows doesn't crash on you, and you don't mind waiting on each\n>task,\n\n\n\tPlease explain.  The only time I wait on anything under Windows is\n\twhen I'm copying or formatting a floppy, or when printing (and even\n\tthen, not long--I get 9 to 11 pages dumped to the printman per \n\tminute, and can _still_ go do things--slowly--while it's doing \n\tthis--I've downloaded with PP+ @9600 while printing).\n\n\n\n> and not being able to adress your memory better than DOS,\n\n\n\tNot sure what you mean here.  OS/2 sees 16 megs, uses 5 or six\n\tof these for it's own use (more if you want to count WinOS/2). \n\tWindows sees 16 megs, uses 3 or 4 (more like 5 if you count the\n\tdisk cache as I am for OS/2) for itself.  If memory efficiency \n\twere a big issue, PC GEOS would be the current king of the \n\tIntel desktop.  \n\n\n> some of the\n>key reasons for using OS/2 are gone.  I probably  would still use it, but it\n>would be more of an even fight.\n\n\n\tOn the other hand.. I am finally able to say with some confidence\n\tthat both OS/2 and Windows have a bit of hardware sensitivity to\n\tthem.  For instance, the machine I am sitting at runs both fine, \n\twhile the machine next to me constantly locks up under Windows. \n\t(But ran OS/2 without a hitch once I got it through a 5-crash \n\tinstall).  On the whole, I'd say OS/2 is a whole lot more sensitive\n\tthan Windows, but there are (I suppose) machines that Windows\n\tjust doesn't like.  \n\n\n>Wittism of th week: \"I think that it's wrong to believe in an ism, you should\n>                     believe in yourself\"  Ferrish Bueller \n\n\t\n\tWasn't this _Ferris_ Bueller?\n\n\n-- \nThere are stupid laws, and then there are stupider than normal laws.\n"

Those\n>who are familiar with Directory Opus on the Amiga know what I'm\n>looking for.\nI have written the file manager HFM, wich has two windows which compare\nthe files in two directorys to find out wether there are equal or \nsimilar files. The 7 most important operations, copy, move, delete,\nshow the file, start a progam, navigate in the directory tree can be\ninvoked by dragging a directory entry with the mouse. This is very\nconvenient, because the selection of the file and the operation to\nbe performed, occur in one move. For bitmap graphic viewing the\nprogram vpic can be integrated, for spreadsheat and database files\nI use the view program from PCTOOLS 7.1. HFM can be configured to\nuse arbitrary viewers to show special data formats. It does\nalso present archives from pkzip etc. as simulated subdirectorys.\nThis filemanager has a somewhat non standart user interface, but\nit is very convienient to use and is the prefered file manager \nin several labs in our university. \nThe drawback of this filemanager is, it's still a dos program and\nthe development of a windows version has not yet begun. I use the\nprogram package run18.zip, where run tells its windows companion\nsched.exe which windows program should be started. In this way you\ncan start a windows program from a dosbox. The new version 3.19\n(to be released soon) includes a new command for automating this\nwindows program start.\nFTP archives for the mentioned programs (all these archives have several\nmirror sites)\nSimtel oak.oakland.edu 141.210.10.117\n/filutl/hfm318.zip\n/gif/vpic60e.zip\nGarbo garbo.uwasa.fi 128.214.87.1\n/dirutil/hfm318.zip\nCICA ftp.cica.indiana.edu 129.79.20.17 \n/util/run18.zip\n-\n\nAndreas Helke, Molekulare Genetik, Universitaet Heidelberg, Germany\nemail un69ef@genius.embnet.dkfz-heidelberg.de\nThe header of this posting does not contain a valid smtp mail address.\n"

Both Type 1 and TT fonts can be of excellent quality and poor quality\nat any size. It all depends on the font's maker and the complexity of the glyphs\nrelated to the size and resolution at which they are viewed. Probably the reason\nfor your opinion/experience that TT is inferior is because most TT fonts on the\nmarket today have been converted from Type 1 outlines to TT either by the font\nvendor or end-users using Fontographer or FontMonger instead of the TT fonts being\nhand-hinted to take advantage of the TT hinting language. At best these converted\nTT fonts will be on a par with the Type 1 font of its orgin.\n\nTrueType is a much richer and more robust hinting language than Type 1 (the hinting\nof diagonals for instance, which TT does and Type 1 cannot). If you check out the\nWindows 3.1 core fonts (Times, Arial, Courier, Symbol, Wingdings) you'll see what can\nbe done with TT. There are other fonts out there that have been hand-hinted and not\njust converted. Some of the Microsoft TT Font Pack 2 fonts are hinted very well.\n\n> You can use both TT and ATM fonts at the same time, if you like.\n> ATM (Type 1) fonts tend to be of higher quality\n> and be more complete in terms of foreign characters.\n\nAgain, not true. The characters in a TT or Type 1 font depend on the maker. If someone\nconverts a Type 1 font to TT they'll only get the characters in the font of orgin. TT\nallows for much more flexibility in this area as well. You can have thousands of glyphs\nin a TT font file (Mac/PS/Windows/Unicode char set) and use the characters appropriate\nfor the particular platform you are running the font on. For instance, all or our fontpack\n2 TT fonts have the Mac/Windows char set in them. The metrics of the fonts are such that\nif the font is brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full mac char set.\n\n\n> Regards,                                            1001-A East Harmony Road\n> Bob Niland                                          Suite 503\n> Internet:  rjn@csn.org                              Fort Collins CO 80525\n> CompuServe: 71044,2124                              (303) 223-5209\n\nHope this clears up some of the confusion.

Windows will use a swap file\nlarger than the recommended size.  Last summer I went to a Microsoft\nWindows 3.1 Technical Workshop and they distributed A LOT of information\nthat the general public might not be aware of.  Anyway in the main book\nthey handed out they have a section on \"Creating larger than recommended\nswapfile\".  I'll quote the information\n\n  If you create a permanent swapfile larger than the recommended size, you\n  will receive a message telling you that Windows will not use anything\n  larger than the recommended size.  THIS ERROR MESSAGE IS INCORRECT, we\n  will allow the use of the larger swapfile, up to four times the amount\n  of RAM on your machine.\n\nSo as you see, Microsoft does know that the information is incorrect.  You\nprobably just ran into some doofball who was new on the job and was only\ntelling you what little he knew.\n\nBe that what it may, I would really suggest to everyone to take the\nopportunity to go to these Technical Workshops.  They aren't actually\nincredibly in-depth, but you do get a lot of material about bugs and\noptimization straight from those in the know.  Besides that they offer\nyou HUGE discounts on software.  If I remember correctly, you could pick\nup Word 2.0, Excel 4.0, or whatever their presentation program is for $130.\nThat is the full blown version, not an upgrade or educational version.  You\ncould also pick up Microsoft Office for $500 or something like that.  Myself\nI sprang for Word.\n\nWell, hope that was helpful to someone.  And besides that I hope someone\nwill go to a workshop and save a little money.\n\nAnd if anyone at Microsoft is reading this -- I really love your products.\nI need a job once I graduate also, can we work something out?  ;-)\n\nThanks,\nBrent Casavant\nbcasavan@mailhost.ecn.uoknor.edu\n\n"

It was never a very stable package, but now it seems to crash every  \nday.  The worst part about it is that it does not crash consistently: ie I  \ncan't reproduce crashes, and they are not always GPF's in the same  \napplication. Sometimes I can recover by simply closing the application  \nthat caused an error, but other times, windows acts very strange, and I  \nneed to re-boot.\n\nSome background:  I have a Leading Edge 486sx25 with Phoenix BIOS.  When I  \nfirst got it it had 4Mg of memory.  It ran windows fine (not too many  \nGPF's).  Then, a couple of weekends ago, I installed Lotus 123 for windows  \n(with ATM), a game card and an additional 4  1Mg SIMMS.  The Leading edge  \nmachine is kind of strange, in that it has the IDE controler built into  \nthe motherboard, the CPU is actually on a sparate board that plugs into  \nthe motherboard and the SIMMS it uses are Macintosh SIMMS! Apparently I  \nwas told that the Leading Edge had the parity bit built into the mother  \nboard.  The original 4Mg 80ns SIMMS where of the 2 chip variety from  \nSAMSUNG, and the ones I installed are 8 chip SIMMS. They are recognized  \nfine by the BIOS RAM check. The game card is a generic $20 gamecard.\n\nThe reason why I mention the hardware like this is that sometimes  \nrebooting the machine using the reset button or ctl-alt-del still leaves  \nthe machine kind of flaky, but turning it on and off doesn't. \n\nI haven't tried taking out the RAM or the game card, because as I said  \nthese GPF are not reproducible at will.  I have gone through and entire  \nday using the computer with no problems and then I might get 5 or so GPF's  \nin the sppace of 20 minutes?\n\nWhat can I do.  This situation is most annoying... Are there any good  \ndiagnostic tools for hardware? Do you think that this might be a software  \nproblem (ie EMM386 etc.)? If it helps, i have manage to get GPF's on After  \nDark, quicken, Paint shop pro. A lot of them have been in user.exe or  \ngdi.exe.\n\nAny help is truly appreciated.....\n\n-Eric\n\nebosco@us.oracle.com\n"

Nothing can recover this \nexcept to completely exit from Windows.

I \nfelt for the money my NEC 5FG that I use at work was a much better monitor.\nThe NEC is sharper, flatter, less distorted, and more stable.  I have heard \ncomplaints from people about the NEC FG series having some quality control \nproblems but mine has been in use for about a year with no problems at all.\n\nThere was nothing really broken with the Viewsonic but overall it did not \nmatch up.  I used my ATI Graphics Ultra in setup mode to push the \nfrequencies to their limits and the Viewsonic exhibited some problems that \nthe NEC did not.  I personally like the non-etched NEC with the OCLI filter \nand the tube on the 17 was not as nice.  The 17 had some uncorrectable \npincusion and edge distortion problems.  Also, it would change brightness \nwhen I switched modes and I was constantly having to fiddle with the \ncontrols.  And the yoke was crooked and I had no way to compensate for the \nraster that tilted downhill.  On the postive side, although not as handsome \nas the NEC, the 17 had a smaller footprint and was not as heavy.\n\nI have heard that Panasonic owns Viewsonic and the model 17 is being sold \nthrough OEM channels with a Panasonic label on it.  If it's available that \nway at a lower cost I could get more serious about it.  For now the NEC has \nmy vote but I'm searching for one of the new, cheaper, NEC 5FGe's to see if \nit's just as good as its older brother the 5FG before I decide which one to \nbuy.\n\nI have no experience with the Nanao.  I can never keep the Nanao models \nstraight and don't have any place I can walk in to get a good comparison of \nall models.\n\n-- \n\nStandard employer disclaimers apply\n\n\n\n-- \nKeith W.

I can tell you that mixing them \nbetween 'banks' ok, and I can't see why mixing in one bank is not unless \nthey are of different speeds ( e.g. mixing of 60ns and 100ns SIMMs in one \nbank ).  The two only differ in the type of chips it uses.  Assuming that \nthe SIMMS are 1Mx9 ( 9 bit wide ), here is the two equivalent \nconfiguration.  The 3-chip SIMM uses two 4-bit wide 4Mbit (1M of 4-bit \nnibbles ) and one 1-bit wide 1Mbit chip ( for a total of 9-bit wide 1Mbyte \n).  The 9-bit SIMM uses nine 1-bit wide 1Mbit chips.  These are equivalent \nbecause of the way that it is 'pinned' on the SIMM board.  At the SIMM \ninterface, they both act as 9-bit wide 1MByte SIMMS ( 2*4+1=9*1 ).  [sorry \nif too techie for ya].\n\n\nMG>> \tSimilarly, one cannot plug in two 1MB SIMMs and one 4MB SIMMs to \ngi\nMG>> the system a total of 6 MEG. Why is that so ?? If my system supports\nMG>> of 8 MEG (it has 8 SIMM slots), can I plug in 4 4MB SIMMs to give my\nMG>> 16MB ??\n\nThat sounds correct.  the problem is that if your computer takes 9-bit \nwide SIMMs, you can not mix different sizes in one bank.  Why you ask?  \nSimple,  if you understand why there is banks.  Assuming you have a 32-bit \nCPU ( 386DX or 486 ), the data bus (e.g. the mechanism to retrieve data \nfrom memory ) is 32-bits wide, so the computer expects to see 32 bits when \nit asks for data.  To get that bandwidth ( 32-bit wide ), the motherboard \nlinks 4 1Mx9 ( one bit is not data, but parity, so I will ignore that in \nthis simple explaination ) to get 32bits [ (9-1)*4=32 bits ].  That means \nthat a SIMM in a bank stores only 1/4 of the 32 bit wide data.  If you \nhave a 16-bit bus, two 1Mx9 SIMMs are linked together to get 16-bit wide \ndata, which is the reason why 286 banks are 2 SIMMs wide, and 32-bit banks \nare 4 SIMMs wide.

It is an S3\n86c805 based card.  I had a problem for a while after installing my\nsecond meg of DRAM for the video, and thanks to Orchid, I got a fix\nfrom their tech support (it was jumper settings not given in the\nordinary manual.  I assume it would come with memory ordered from\nthem, so I guess I should be glad they didn't just say \"Buy the memory\nfrom us\" or something like that.)\n\n\tThe one thing that I was puzzled by was why there was not a\n1024x768x32k color mode on the thing, either in full screen or\nenlarged desktop mode.  My ATI Ultra Plus can handle that, given 2MB\nof memory.  All the 2MB buys you on the Fahrenheit is 1280x1024x256.\nJust ONE more mode.  GEEZ.  Had I known, I wouldn't have bothered.  I\nasked them why, and all I got was \"Your point is well taken, but\nOrchid's software developers are busy with other projects.\"\n\n\tSo, to get to the point, finally, ARE there any s3 86c805\ndrivers out there that can handle high res hicolor modes?  I'd love to\nget another card, but perhaps it will have to wait until the next\ngeneration of cards comes out, since this card came bundled with my\nsystem and it's not so easy to exchange these things unless they're\nbroken.\n\n\tIf you want these modes, steer away from Orchids s3 86c805\ncards (ie. VLB or VA/VLB), at least until their developers are \"less\nbusy\".  If the magazines are to believed, I've only seen one s3 86c805\nproduct thus far which can handle 1024x768x32k color (Genoa?),\nalthough evenn that might be a misprint.\n\n\tPlease, if there are generic or semi-generic drivers out\nthere, let me know where I can get them.  800x600x32k is OK, but I\ncoulda gotten that with my ATI VGA Wonder XL.\n\nThanks.\ndonyee@athena.mit.edu\n"

                    "content": "From: sherwood@adobe.com (Geoffrey Sherwood)\nSubject: Orchid P9000 vs Fahrenheit (mini review)\n\n\nI just purchased a Viewsonic 17 and and Orchid P9000.  In short, I am happy\nwith the monitor and unhappy with the card.  I have spent a lot more time\nfutzing with the card, so that is what I am going to write about.  The monitor\nis pretty.  The moires I had under Simcity on my 17\" Magnavox went away.  It\nisn't as heavy as I thought it would be (45 lbs, I think).  So much for the\nmonitor.  On to the bitch session and test results.\n\nIn going with the modern trend, the Orchid P9000 card only supports 16 colors\nin 640x480 mode without a driver.  Of course, this breaks any DOS program\nwhich uses SVGA modes (like most of my CD-ROMs).  The Compudyne Whiplash VGA,\nOrchid Fahrenheit 1280, and Orchid F. VLB all share this limitation.  Those\nare all S3 cards, which means it is an S3 problem for them (the P9000 uses\na Weitek VGA chip which also doesn't support them).  The Hercules Graphite\ncard does seem to have these modes, but I didn't run the same test cases as\nI did on the other boards during the brief time I had it.  It was able to\nprint the splash screen for the Grolier's Encyclopedia, though, which the S3\ncards just printed as hash, which is why I suspect the SVGA modes are supported.\n\nThe supported resolutions really annoy me.  You can do 1280x1024 at 75Hz if\nyou tell the driver you have an NEC 5FG (they only have about six monitors\nlisted plus 'Generic', and if you choose Generic you can't get any high\nrefreshes at ALL).  But at 1024x768 you are limited to 70Hz.  Seems to me\nthat the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth (if it can do 75Hz\nat 1280 it sure should be able to do it at 1024!).  Higher vertical resolution\nwas the main reason I bought the card over the Orchid F. VLB I currently have,\nand it will do 1024x768x70 Hz as well.\n\nThe higher graphics modes all crash HP Dashboard.  I just got off the phone\nwith Orchid, and with the 1.1 drivers (I don't know what I have) he was unable\nto recreate the problem.  On the plus side, their tech rep was as helpful as\nhe could be and booted up the program on his computer to verify he didn't have\nthe problem.  He didn't know why they limited the refresh to 70 Hz either.\n\nThe board is faster that the OFVLB for most things according to the Hercules\nSpeedy program. This program tests various operations and reports the results\nin pixels/second.  I don't have the numbers for the Graphite card, but they\nwere close to half of the OFVLB (ie, slower) but that was running in a 20MHz\n386, ISA, so the numbers aren't really comparable.  The following numbers\nwere all obtained using a 486, 33 MHz, AIR motherboard (UMC chipset), with\n8 MB memory.  I give ranges because the program reports the numbers as it\ncomputes them, and these tend to jump around a bit.\n\n\nK means thousand (not 1024), M means million, pixels per second\n\n             Orchid Fahrenheit VLB                  Orchid P9000\nChip                 S3 805                          Weitek 9000\nDIB to Screen        182K - 190K                     228K - 240K\nMemory to Screen     5.9M - 6.2M                     8.4M - 8.9M\nScreen to Screen     14M - 14.8M                     29M - 30.8M\nVector, solid        2.4M                            2.8M - 2.9M\nVector, styled       55K - 58K                       449K - 473K\nPolygon, shaded      1.8M - 2.1M                     1.6M - 1.9M\nPolygon, hatched     6.9M - 7.9M                     1.3M - 1.7M\nTernary Rops         1.9M - 2.4M                     477K - 520K\nFont                 130K - 160K                     46K - 55K / 1.2M\n\nThe DIB to Screen test takes a device independent bitmap of a face and transfers\nit to the screen.  I have no idea what is being done internally as far as\nconversions go.  The memory to screen takes the same face and copies it to\nthe screen, my guess is after it has been rasterized into a bitmap that can\njust be copied to the video display.  The screen to screen test copies that\nface from place to place on the screen.  Awesome!  Interestingly, the solid\nvectors and shaded polygons show no improvement, and hatched polygons (ie,\nfilled with cross-hatching) and Ternary Rops (whatever they are.  Graphics\noperations like XORs maybe????) are a dead loss on the 9000.  I give two\nnumbers for the 9000 fonts, because I think they are caching.\nWhen the fonts are first drawn on the screen they are done fairly slowly --\n1/3 the speed of the OFVLB.  Then the speed increases dramatically.  Sounds\nlike programming to a benchmark to me....\n\nI make no claims that these numbers mean anything at all.  Its just what\nI saw when I ran them on my computer.  I normally don't write disclaimers,\nbut this time maybe I'd better.  My testing is totally unconnected with my\nwork (I program under UNIX on Decstations) is done completely without the\nknowledge, blessing, or equipment of my company.\n\ngeoff sherwood\n"

That most PC's only have (or had) 1 hard drive and\nrun DOS?  That SCSI hard drives cost a lot more than MFM or RLL drives\nat the time?

This is because it's like te PC AT hard disk\ninterface.  The controller moves a sector to some buffer memory on the\ncontroller card, then the CPU moves the data from the buffer to main\nmemory where it's needed.  If IDE doesn't work this way, then it's not\ncompatible.\n\nHeck, if IDE used DMA, then you'd hear all kinds of complaints about\nISA bus systems with more than 16M RAM not working with their IDE\ndrives.  16M is the DMA addressing limit of the ISA bus, and if IDE\ndid DMA there would be trouble.\n\n(BTW, there are DMA-enabling signals in the IDE cable spec, but the\nlast report I heard was that they are never implemented, because it\nwould require a different kind of IDE adapter and different drivers.)\n-- \nRichard Krehbiel                                 richk@grebyn.com\nOS/2 2.0 will do for me until AmigaDOS for the 386 comes along...\n"

Fixed disk\nsectors are buffered by the controller, and transferring them to\nmemory with a 'rep insw' (or whatever the instruction is called) is\nquite efficient (single instruction, goes as fast as the\ncontroller/cpu know how to use the bus).

This frees the\nSCSI bus for other devices. This is typically used in a multi-tasking OS to\nstart transfers on several devices. While each device is seeking the data the\nbus is free for other commands and data transfers. When the devices are\nready to transfer the data they can aquire the bus and send the data.\n\nOn an IDE bus when you start a transfer the bus is busy until the disk has seeked\nthe data and transfered it.

The controller will do the necessary translation automatically, in\nmost cases.\n\nWARNING!!!  Do not use a BIOS setting that is even one byte larger than the\nactual size of the drive!  A smaller setting will not harm the drive, but\nyou will be sorry if you go even one byte over.  Drive damage will not\nresult, but headaches will!\n\n...

Apple cannot patent the concept of a region.\n\nI'm guessing that either NuTek reverse-engineered Apple's internal data\nstructure for regions (I dunno if this would hold up in court), or they\ncame up with their own data structure.  If it's the latter, then they\nwon't be able to draw PICT files containing regions.  Besides PICT files,\nthere aren't many places where regions are stored on disk.  (QuickTime\nmovies, perhaps?)  As long as the region isn't being stored on disk and\ntransferred from a Mac to a NuTek clone (or vice versa), it doesn't\nmatter if NuTek uses a completely different internal data structure.\n\nI remember reading that Apple also has a patent on their ADB hardware,\nand that the NuTek clones would therefore be lacking an ADB port.  What\nother patents does Apple have on the Mac?\n-- \nJoe Schwartz       E-mail: xor@acm.rpi.edu  or  xor@clotho.acm.rpi.edu\nMapInfo Corp.\n200 Broadway       These are my own opinions.

Some new\ndrives perform it in order to increase overall integrity of data\nwrites. Basically, the firmware instructs the actuator to perform\na test to see if the data tracks are within a certain physical\ntolerance, since when the media heats up or cools down, *some*\ntrack drift is inevitable, and the drive has to monitor it. This\nbecomes especially critical at very high recording densities, and\nso was used primarily on very large-capacity mechanisms, but it\nseems to be finding its way into more smaller drives as a way of\nboosting the drive's long-term reliability and MTBF ratings.\n\nI first became aware of thermal recalibration when it was pointed\nout that the technique conflicts with prolonged write times when\ndigitizing, say, audio or video to hard disk. Some manufacturers\nexplicitly state that drives with thermal recalibration are NOT\nto be used for applications that have prolonged disk writes.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nVictor\n"

You will see the floppy disk and\n    hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. Follow the usual anti-static\n    precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do\n    this. Unplug the wall and monitor power supply cords from the back\n\tof the mac.\n \n3)  Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the\n    tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up.\n    The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the\n    tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. You may\n    also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power\n    supply. Leave that alone. The plastic tab from the tower is all you\n    need release.\n \n4)  Look at the rear of the tower assembly. You will see the flat ribbon\n    SCSI connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable\n    leading to the floppy drive. Disconnect all these from the motherboard.\n    The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed\n    to release it.\n                                            \n5)  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount\n\n6)  Look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. A\n    phillips head screw is at the base. Remove it, taking care not to drop\n    it into the case. A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful\n    here.\n\n7)  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the\n    right side of the tower. This tab prevents the tower from sliding\n\tposteriorly. Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then\n\tlift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case.\n\n8)  Congratulations, you have now gained access to your machine's SIMM\n    slots.\n\n9)  The six big slots are for VRAM. One usually must install all six to\n    gain useful video modes. All SIMMS (RAM or VRAM)  installed with their\n\tchips facing the front of the motherboard.\n\t\n    The four smaller sockets in front are for RAM SIMMS. Install SIMMS in\n\tsets of four into these sockets. Be sure you seat the SIMMS squarely\n\tand firmly into a fully upright position.\n\t\n10) Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the\n    tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about\n\t1 cm posterior of its intended position. Lower the tower assembly into\n\tplace while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case.\n    Once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks\n    into place.\n\t\n11) Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY\n    DRIVE CABLE.\n\n12) Replace the phillips head screw\n\n13) Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in.\n\n14) Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount\n\nGuy Kuo <guykuo@u.washington.edu>\n\n"

Okay, I \nguess I should have somehow known that this was the case.\nLet the buyer beware, huh Apple?\n\tBe that as it may, I have been thinking about the \nproblem and I'm puzzled. Why  can't a defencieny in the \nROM be made up for in software. I write software for a living\n(on unix platforms) and I don't understand the \"it just\ncan't be done\" responses I've gotten from those I have\nasked so far.  Isn't Mode32, or somesuch piece of  soft-\nware, just such a fix. \n\tAnyway, I was hoping someone knowledgeable\nabout Mac internals could set me straight: is it simply\nimpossible for a mac SE to print grayscale, or could\nsomeone armed with enough info and a little pro-\ngramming experience cook something up that would\nsupplement the ROM's capabilities?\n\tAlso, how does one know if one's mac can\nsupport the grayscale and photograde that the Select 300\nis supposedly capable of? ( Short of buying the printer\nand trying it out like I did)\n\tThanks for your help.\n \nBill Wright\nwgw@netcom.com\n\t\n"

I think\nwe'll be answering this question for about the next year or so. There is\nno \"option\" to get an FPU on a C650. What you have is a choice of CPUs:\nthere is the 68LC040 that does not have an integrated FPU like the full\n'040 and is only present in the base 4/80 model of the C650 (AppleUSA).\nAnd there is the full '040 which you get when you order anything other\nthan the base 4/80 configuration. Therefore, since you have ordered one\nof the 8MB versions with on-board Ethernet models you will not be\ngetting the LC040. But even if you wanted to have the LC040 you wouldn't\nbe able to order a C650 with 8MB RAM, on-board Ethernet and an LC040.\nIt's not an \"option.\"\n    Also, a note to people out there that have 4/80 C650s and C610s\nthinking that there is an optional FPU, the '040 class chip cannot\nrecognize an external FPU, so there is no socket on the motherboard for\na FPU chip and you cannot go out and purchase an FPU on a PDS card or\nsomething like that. The only way to get an FPU in these machines is to\nreplace the LC040 with a full '040. And if you have a C610, you will not\nneed to worry about a heat sink if you do replace the LC040 with the\nfull '040, but if you have a 4/80 C650 you do need to have a heat sink.\n\n-Hades\n\n"

I have a record that shows a IIsi with and without a 64KB cache.\nIt's small enough that I will attach it.\n\nI have also measured some real programs with and without the 64 KB\ncache.  The speedup varies a lot from app to app, ranging from 0% to\n40%.  I think an average of 20%-25% is about right.  The subjective\ndifference is not great, but is sometimes noticable.  A simple cache\ncard certainly does not transform a IIsi into something enormously\nbetter.  I do not have an FPU.\n\nThe conventional wisdom says that cache cards from all of the makers\noffer about the same speedup and that there is not much difference\nbetween 32K and 64K caches.

This past month, I bought a Quadra 800 and am now \nusing the Sony on it.  My SE/30 has been shipped home to my father who\nis planning on getting an Apple 14\" monitor (The Trinitron one).  My\nquestion is this:  What kind of power cord will he get with the Apple\nmonitor.  Does it come with two types?  As I recall, one can hook up the\npower cord of an apple monitor to the back of a machine such as my \nQuadra 800.  However, for my father's SE/30, there is no extra plug which\nallows use of the SE/30's power supply.  He needs to plug it into the\nsocket separately.  So...does the monitor come with a cable that will allow\nhim to do this?  Will have to buy a different cable?

If your power cord is the kind that detaches from the back of the\nmonitor (most common) you can get a *replacement* power cord that will go\nfrom the monitor to the back of the computer.\n\n2. You can get an adpater that connects to the plug end of the existing\npower cord and provides the proper end that plugs into the back of the\ncomputer.\n\nBoth cost about the same (aprox. $5) and are available from many computer\nstores (clone dealers are usually better at having these things and at\ngood prices). Power cords are standard, so you don't have to go looking\nfor some special thing at a Mac store.\n"

They \nX\t  should not be required to exist.\nX\nX\t  If your entry does not need an info file, skip the ---info---\nX\t  section.  If your entry needs multiple info files, use multiple \nX\t  ---info--- sections, one per info file.  You should describe\nX\t  each info file in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    4) If your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows:\nX\nX\t   'build' is incorporated into a makefile, and 'build' is removed\nX\t   'prog.c' is renamed to your entry's title, followed by an optional\nX\t       digit, followed by '.c'\nX\t   your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry's\nX\t       title, possibly followed by a digit\nX\nX       If your entry requires that a build file exist, state so in your\nX       entry's remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to execute a\nX       build shell script containing the 'build' information.  The name of\nX       this build shell script will be your entry's title, possibly followed\nX       by a digit, followed by '.sh'.\nX\nX       If needed, your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry must\nX       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames.\nX\nX    5) The build file, the source and the resulting executable should be\nX       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files,\nX       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If this\nX       occurs, state so in your entry's remarks.\nX\nX    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected.\nX       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted, as long as it does not \nX       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers.\nX\nX    7) The program must be of original work.  All programs must be in the\nX       public domain.  All copyrighted programs will be rejected.\nX\nX    8) Entries must be received prior to 07-May-93 0:00 UTC.

The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions.\nX    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are\nX    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines.\nX\nX    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries.\nX    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines.\nX\nX\nXWHAT IS NEW IN 1993:\nX\nX    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c\nX    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT.\nX\nX    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C\nX    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers \nX    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with \nX    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor \nX    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES.\nX\nX\nXHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS:\nX\nX    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See\nX    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners.\nX\nX    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries\nX    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year\nX    might be 'old' the next year.\nX\nX    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply\nX    a number of tests to an entry:\nX\nX\t* look at the original source\nX\t* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII\nX\t* C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines\nX\t* C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines\nX\t* run it through a C beautifier\nX\t* examine the algorithm\nX\t* lint it\nX\t* compile it\nX\t* execute it\nX\nX    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests.\nX    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been\nX    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier.\nX\nX    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain\nX    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the\nX    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as\nX    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given\nX    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that\nX    does something interesting when you run it.\nX\nX    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave\nX    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life\nX    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request\nX    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the\nX    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way.\nX\nX    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know\nX    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse\nX    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the\nX    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to\nX    annoy more than amuse.\nX\nX    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries\nX    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules'\nX    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use\nX    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-)\nX\nX    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make\nX    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly\nX    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some\nX    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work.\nX\nX    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that\nX    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off\nX    documenting it.  Noting \"this entry sometimes prints the 4th power\nX    of a prime by mistake\" would save the above entry.  And sometimes,\nX    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly\nX    working entry is best.\nX\nX\nXOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES:\nX\nX    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We\nX    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests\nX    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as far\nX    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion.\nX\nX    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we:\nX\nX\t#define d define\nX\t#d foo\t\t   <-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo\nX\nX\tint i;\nX\tj;\t\t   <-- don't use such implicit type declaration\nX\tint k;\nX\nX    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you \nX    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in \nX    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers.\nX\nX    Unfortunately, ANSI C requires array indexes to be of integral type.\nX    Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed:\nX\nX\tint i;\nX\tchar *c;\nX\ti[c];\t\t   <--- use c[i] instead\nX\t(i+3)[\"string\"];   <--- use \"string\"[i+3] instead\nX\nX    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of\nX    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety\nX    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are\nX    not portable and must not be used:\nX\nX\t* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable\nX\t* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable\nX\t* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg\nX\t* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg\nX\t* performing arithmetic on va_list variables\nX\t* using va_list as a structure or union\nX\nX    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s.\nX\nX    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead.\nX\nX    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...),\nX    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While some\nX    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not.\nX\nX    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries\nX    must not assume that it returns an int.\nX\nX    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise.\nX    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do\nX    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people\nX    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for\nX    programs that are compact, and are instructional.\nX\nX    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80\nX    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion.\nX\nX    We tend to dislike programs that:\nX\nX\t* are very hardware specific\nX\t* are very OS or Un*x version specific\nX\t     (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific\nX\t      code is likely not to be)\nX\t* dump core or have compiler warnings\nX\t     (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item)\nX\t* won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x\nX\t* abusing the build file to get around the size limit\nX\t* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs\nX\t* are longer than they need to be\nX\t* are similar to previous winners\nX\t* are identical to previous losers  :-)\nX\nX    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the\nX    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program\nX    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines.\nX\nX    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size\nX    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out,\nX    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order to\nX    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel\nX    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off\nX    if you show some amount of restraint.\nX\nX    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact\nX    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get\nX    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters.\nX\nX    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob\nX    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C\nX    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third\nX    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting\nX    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two!\nX\nX    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating'\nX    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim\nX    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating\nX    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating.\nX    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others)\nX    know of a smaller one!\nX\nX    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that\nX    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't\nX    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't depend\nX    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store.\nX\nX    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and\nX    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client\nX    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the\nX    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a).\nX    Don't use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone\nX    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not\nX    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or\nX    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better\nX    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems.\nX\nX    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on\nX    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines\nX    in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    We like programs that:\nX\nX\t* are as concise and small as they need to be\nX\t* do something at least quasi-interesting\nX\t* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice)\nX\t* are portable\nX\t* are unique or novel in their obfuscation style\nX\t* MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION\nX\t* make us laugh and/or throw up  :-)\nX\nX    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course, your\nX    program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several\nX    areas really does help.\nX\nX    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in\nX    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to\nX    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two.\nX    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well.\nX\nX    Be creative!\nX\nX\nXENTRY FORMAT:\nX\nX    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your\nX    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format,\nX    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the\nX    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS)\nX\nX    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to\nX    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that\nX    is found in mkentry.c:\nX\nX\tThis program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every\nX\tattempt has been made to make sure that this program produces\nX\tan entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases,\nX\twhere this program differs from the contest rules, the\nX\tcontest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the\nX\tcontest rules before submitting an entry.\nX\nX    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however,\nX    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check\nX    the entry against the size rules.\nX\nX    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about\nX    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.  (see below)\nX\nX    The following is a sample entry:\nX\nX---entry---\nXrule:\t1993\nXfix:\tn\nXtitle:\tchonglab\nXentry:\t0\nXdate:\tMon Mar  1 08:45:20 1993\nXhost:\tUn*x v6, pdp11/45\nX\t2.9BSD, pdp11/70\nX---remark---\nX    This is a non-obfuscated obfuscated C program.\nX\nX    It is likely not to win a prize.

If an entry wins, we will rename\nX    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition,\nX    we use the name of the entry's title, followed by an optional\nX    digit in case of name conflicts.\nX\nX    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award,\nX    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab.\nX\nX    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, source\nX    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in the\nX    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpful\nX    if you did one of the following:\nX\nX\t* Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry.\nX\nX\t* Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example:\nX\nX\t\tcc prog.c -o special_name\t\tneed special binary\nX\nX\t    or  rm -f special_src.c\t\t\tneed special source\nX\t\tcp prog.c special_src.c\nX\t\tcc special_src.c -o special_name\nX\nX\t    or  rm -f special_build\t\t\tneed special build\nX\t\ttail +4 build > special_build\nX\t\tsh < special_build\nX\nX\t* Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of \nX\t  your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You \nX\t  should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections.\nX\nX    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files,\nX    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid\nX    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should\nX    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This\nX    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch.\nX\nX    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We\nX    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the\nX    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them\nX    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files,\nX    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed,\nX    then skip the ---info--- section.\nX\nX    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that\nX    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an\nX    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample\nX    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a\nX    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a\nX    'hints' file.\nX\nX    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For\nX    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed\nX    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental,\nX    the entry should not require them exist.\nX\nX    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name\nX    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason,\nX    say so in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they\nX    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say\nX    so in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has\nX    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should\nX    have entry number 0.\nX\nX    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry\nX    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place text outside of the\nX    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't\nX    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the \nX    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at:\nX\nX\t...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges\t(not the address for\nX\tjudges@toad.com\t\t\t\t\t submitting entries)\nX    \nX    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer \nX    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as \nX    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is:\nX\nX\tThr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993\nX\nX    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The\nX    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many \nX    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string:\nX\nX\tdate -u \"+%a %h %d %T 19%y\"\nX\tdate -u | sed -e 's/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/'\nX\tsh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e \"s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/\"'\nX\tsh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e \"s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/\"'\nX\tsh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e \"s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/\"'\nX\nX    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, set\nX    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'.\nX    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number\nX    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be\nX    replaced.\nX\nX\nXJUDGING PROCESS:\nX\nX    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll.\nX\nX    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message\nX    is unpacked into individual files, each containing:\nX\nX\t---entry--- section\nX\tall ---author--- sections\nX\tall ---info--- sections\nX\t---build--- section\nX\t---program--- section\nX\tany other text, including the Email message headers\nX\nX    Prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure\nX    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was\nX    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the\nX    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is\nX    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award.\nX\nX    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular\nX    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are\nX    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding\nX    out in the end, who won and where they were from.\nX\nX    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award.\nX    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make all\nX    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning\nX    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even\nX    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious,\nX    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC\nX    winners at talks)\nX\nX    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the\nX    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give\nX    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their\nX    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We\nX    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well.\nX    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world.\nX\nX    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round,\nX    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles;\nX    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does\nX    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the\nX    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings.\nX\nX    A reading consists of a number of actions:\nX\nX\t* reading the ---entry--- section\nX\t* reading the uudecoded ---build--- section\nX\t* reading the uudecoded ---program--- section\nX\t* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any\nX\t* passing the source thru the C pre-processor\nX\t    shipping over any #include files\nX\t* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source\nX\t* passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor\nX\t    shipping over any #include files\nX\nX    In later rounds, other actions are performed:\nX\nX\t* linting the source\nX\t* compiling/building the source\nX\t* running the program\nX\t* performing misc tests on the source and binary\nX\nX    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries\nX    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it\nX    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round.\nX    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form\nX    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards.\nX    An entry often will compete in several categories.\nX\nX    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries\nX    we receive.  A typical category list might be:\nX\nX\t* best small one line program\nX\t* best small program\nX\t* strangest/most creative source layout\nX\t* most useful obfuscated program\nX\t* best game that is obfuscated\nX\t* most creatively obfuscated program\nX\t* most deceptive C code\nX\t* best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES)\nX\t* best abuse of ANSI C\nX\t* worst abuse of the rules\nX\t* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award>\nX\nX    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so\nX    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round.\nX    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary.\nX\nX    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of\nX    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10\nX    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into\nX    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not\nX    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is\nX    less clear cut.\nX\nX    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out\nX    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is\nX    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry \nX    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course, \nX    that the entry is worth improving in the first place!\nX\nX    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a\nX    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest\nX    rules in some way.\nX\nX    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such\nX    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the\nX    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories.\nX\nX\nXANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS:\nX\nX    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition,\nX    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to\nX    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF.\nX\nX    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups:\nX\nX\t    comp.lang.c\t\t  comp.unix.wizards\talt.sources\nX\nX    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following\nX\nX\t    comp.sources.d\t  alt.sources.d\t\tmisc.misc\nX\t    comp.sources.misc\t  comp.windows.x\nX\nX    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.  See\nX    below for details.\nX\nX    Often, winning entries are published in selected magazines.  Winners \nX    have appeared in books (\"The New Hackers Dictionary\") and on T-Shirts.\nX\nX    Last, but not least, winners receive international fame and flames!  :-)\nX\nX\nXFOR MORE INFORMATION:\nX\nX    You may contact the judges by sending Email to the following address:\nX\nX\t...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges\t(not the address for\nX\tjudges@toad.com\t\t\t\t\t submitting entries)\nX\nX    Questions and comments about the contest are welcome.\nX\nX    One may obtain a copy of the current rules, guidelines or mkentry\nX    program.

In this configuration, X windows\napplications (particularly xdvi) work fine.  However, if he opens up a\nsecond xterm application, suddenly xdvi cannot start in either window,\ngiving the error: Unable to load ISO 8859-1 font.\n\n   The only difference between the two xterm windows is that the initial\none references a different name in the Xsession file, with prettier\ncolours and other slight changes.  Further investigation shows that only\nopening a default xterm causes this behaviour, and more significant, ALL\nX applications can no longer load any fonts if they are invoked from the\ncommand line in either window.  If I start the xterm with a different\nfont (using the -fn option), no problems.  It would seem that the\ndefault xterm is loading a font which somehow causes the server to lose\nall of its fonts.  Note: xlsfonts in either window shows all of the\nfonts available, so there doesn't appear to be a problem in the font\ndirectories/hash-tables.\n\n   Other than rewriting the XTerm app-defaults file to use a different\nfont and hope for the best, does anyone have any ideas?\n\nMore info:  This is the most recent MIPS workstation (R4000 I believe),\n       with the most current operating system and running X11R5.\n       It is not mwm's fault, as the same problems occur under twm, etc.\n"

When using\non-server pixmaps or shared memory, I had to insert a delay loop to keep\nit from going too quickly :). Testing both methods side by side, they\nwere just about equal.\n\n  The advantage of SHM is that your X server doesn't grow to ridiculous\nsizes; but pixmaps can work over a network and *are* removed if your\napplication dies (one tends to use ipcrm manually quite a bit when\ndebugging SHM apps).\n\n  Shared memory also has the problem that some operating systems (e.g.\nUltrix) seem to allow only a small number of segments (~6) to be\nattached to a process at once; consequently, a redraw becomes\nXShmAttach();XShmPutImage();XShmDetach(); on Dec systems. And Dec's 24\nbit displays (like the ones I tend to use most often) don't seem to\nsupport the extension (maybe someone compiled them wrong?), and using\npixmaps causes the X server to crash (failed mallocs), so one *has* to\nuse the local unix domain socket (which really isn't that bad; one\ncopies the info three times per redraw instead of one).\n\n  In short: allowing all three forms of display, within the program is a\nGood Thing (minus SHM if running over a network), and let the user pick\nwhatever feels fastest.\n\n  (I just use an ximagehandler class and forget about it :)\n\n  )Rob\n"

I don't particularly want this discussion to spark\na lengthy debate, but I do think it's worth pointing out that \"popular\nusage\" is not always sufficient excuse.  \n\nIn this case, for example, I think an appropriate parallel may be found\nin the pronunciation of proper names: if people commonly misspelled or \nmispronounced your name, would you feel compelled to change it?  Probably\nnot.  \n\nThe same is true of X.  \"The X Window System\", \"X\", \"X11\", and related\nmonickers are proper names in the same sense that any product name is a\nproper name.  In fact, some of them are *trademarked* names.  The fact \nthat many people get them wrong is largely beside the point.  \n\nAs for the trade publications that promulgate things like \"X Window\" or\n\"X.windows\" or any of the other nonsensical variants one often sees, \nconsider the fact that these publications are supposedly written by \n*journalists*.

Yes, yes, I know Motorola\nHTs are bullet-proof, unbreakable, plutonium-based \nindestructable -- you can drive a tank over them and they'll\nstill work.  But just how often does that come up?  Why are hams\nwilling (and they *are*) to spend the price of a synthaszied\ndual-bander for a 2-channel xtal rig???  Note: this is not\na flame; as I said, I'm sure this is a good deal for this rig.\nI'm just amazed that it *is* a good deal.  I would have guessed\nthat a 2 channel xtal rig could never be worth as much as a dual-\nbander to a ham, no matter how durable.

I'm sorry if anyone thinks that I am wasting\nspace, but I thought you might want some relief from the \"So-and-so is a thief\"\nposts.  Not that I think we shouldn't hear about the bad deals, but it would be\nnice to hear some good news once in a while.\n\nAfter seeing his post on one of the for sale groups, I mailed Mr. Mark Miller a\nrequest for his copy of WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS.  He suggested a price of $50\nin his ad, but when I phoned him, he quoted $40 plus shipping.  That sounded\nmore than fair to me, so I told him that I would send him a check the next day. \nImagine my surprise when I logged into my account the following day and found a\nmessage from him saying that it had already been sold (after I had just mailed\nthe money order).  After another E-Mail message to him, he apologized and\nassured me that it was a mistake - I was the one who he was holding it for.  He\nsent the package as soon as he got the money, along with a letter stating a\ntransfer of license.  This wasn't good enough for WordPerfect, so I asked him\nto fill out one of their forms.  No problem - we thought.  It took three times\nto get it to the right address (my fault).  Anyway, he mailed me the form for\nmy signature and included a Workbook that I had no idea was included in the\ndeal.  Again, he apologized for not sending it before.  I now have the world's\nbest word processor and a renewed hope in the world that there are a few good\nones left.  I recoend that if you ever see that Mark is selling anything thatat\nyou may want, give him a call.  If I had the choice, I would purchase all of my\nsoftware from him.\n\nBravo, Mr. Miller!\n\n- Kevin Harter\n"

                    "content": "From: wdempsey@athena.mit.edu (Wayne R Dempsey)\nSubject: Computer Equipment Garage Sale!!!\n\n\nComputer Equipment Garage Sale:\n\nI've finally decided to clean out my closets and get rid of some of the stuff\nthat is broken or not being used by me.  I've put together a list and\nindicated what I think each item is worth.  This is just my estimate, and I\nam very open to any offers, including trades.  I'm currently looking for\nsome CD-ROMs that will work with a Mac CD ROM player CD Caddies, HD floppy \ndisks, any used Macintosh software, a 387-33Mhz Co-Processor, or basically \nanything you have lying around (cans of soup, the neighbor's cat, etc...)  \nMake me an offer, no offer will be overlooked... \nI really want to get rid of this stuff...\n\nOk, Here's the list:\n\n52 Meg 3.5\" SCSI Hard Drive.  Conner Model #CP-3150.  I bought this from a guy\n\tat a swap meet to use with my Macintosh.  Unfortunately, I can't seem \n\tto get it to work with the SCSI controller in my computer.  The\n\tguy tested it with his PC, and printed out a copy of the Norton Disk \n\tDoctor report which says it has no bad sectors. (I'll send you a copy) \n\tI was dumb enough not to get his phone number, so I can't return it to \n\thim. The drive has many jumpers on it, (which I don't know how to set) \n\tso maybe that's the problem.  I was quite disappointed that it didn't\n\twork so I'm trying to minimize my losses.\t~$45\n\n52 Meg 3.5\" SCSI Hard Drive. Conner Model #CP-3150.  Same situation as above.\n\tI bought both of these drives from the same guy.  Despite the different\n\tmodel numbers they are the same exact drive.  Same report from NDD\n\t(I have one for each drive) will be included.\t~$45\n\n40 Meg SONY 3.5\" SCSI Hard Drive.  SONY Model #SRD2040A.  The drive mechanism \n\tis completely trashed.  This hard drive was in my computer (Mac SE) and\n\thad a stiction problem.  Well, repeated banging on the side of the\n\tcomputer resulted in a head crash (yes, metal scraping metal) which\n\twas not too pleasant to listen to.  Still the SCSI controller\n\tcard is in good working order, and can be used for parts, or a \n\tproject.\t~$20\n\n65 Meg Seagate 5.25\" HH SCSI Hard Drive.  Model #ST-277N.  I originally bought\n\tthis drive, because it had a small stiction problem, and I though that\n\tI could fix it.  Well I determined that the drive mechanism was fine,\n\tand that it was a controller problem.  (motor controller wasn't sending\n\tproper signals.)  Well, after taking the controller off the drive, \n\tlooking at it, and putting it back together, I realized that I\n\taccidentally severed one of the small flat cables that connect the \n\tdrive to the controller.  I tried to solder it, but I'm not that good\n\tat soldering so I couldn't do it.  Worked perfectly before I messed\n\tup.  I used it as a temporary drive when the SONY (above) crashed on\n\tme.  Also loaded the drive with about twenty Mac applications,\n\tworth well over $1000.  (Claris CAD, MS Word 5.0, Think C,\n\tExcel, and many others) \n\tI think all it needs is a resoldering of that cable.  You also get all\n\tthe software on the drive. (if you can accept being a pirate)  I only \n\task that you delete my data files from the drive.  I was really angry\n\twhen I broke that connection, and then couldn't fix it.  I just don't \n\thave time to play with it any more.\t~$65\n\nAT&T ISDN 7500 Modem.  This is for use on digital phone systems.  If you know\n\twhat this is or would like technical information on it, let me know.  I\n\thave some tech documents on it.  Is supposed to be the same thing as an\n\tAT&T digital phone, but without the phone part.  It seems to be in  \n\tworking order (passes self test perfectly OK).  I have no idea how \n\tthis is worth...   Let me know if you're interested.\n\nMotorola 68881 CoProcessor.  I haven't tested this one out yet, but if anyone \n\tis interested I will get it tested out, to make sure that it works.  I\n\thad trouble using it with my accelerator board, but then I spoke to the\n\tmanufacturer of the board and found out it couldn't be used without \n\tanother controller chip.  When I was looking around to buy one new, the\n\tprices were around $100.  I will guarantee this to work.\t~$65\n\nCGA Card.  Half-Length. 8-bit.  Wasn't working last time I checked (although\n\tI think I was using a bad monitor)\t~$5\n\n5.25\"\t360K Floppy Drive.  IBM Drive Type 1355.  Guaranteed to work, \n\tbecause when I took it out of the PC, it was working!\t\t~$25\n\n5.25\" 360K Floppy Drive.  Toshiba Model Number ND-08DE-A.  Guaranteed to \n\twork.  Came out of same PC as above.\t~$25\n\n5.25\"\tFloppy Drives.  Can't guarantee that these will work.  I don't\n\teven know if they are low or high density drives.  I don't have\n\tany method of testing them.\n\t\tPanasonic Model number: JU-455-5 ACG.  There's another\n\t\t\tnumber on it: 2626-361723.\n\t\tPanasonic Model number: JU-475-2 AGG.  There's also\n\t\t\tanother number on it: H3649-101457\n\t\tToshiba Model Number ND-08DE.  Virtually identical to the one \n\t\t\tabove.\n\tEach Drive ~$10\n\n3.5\" PS/2 Drive.  These things are proprietary, so I can't test it, but I\n\tthink it works.  Not sure if it's high density or low density, but I\n\tsuppose someone who is looking for one would know.  Model Number\n\tDFL413C04A.  I think these things are expensive to replace.  ~$35\n\nMFM Hard Drive Controller Cards.  I've got three of these, and I have no way\n\tof testing them.  Two of them are 8-bit cards, and one is a sixteen bit\n\tcard with a floppy controller built in.\t~$10 for the 8-bits ~$15 for\n\tthe 16-bit card w/floppy.\n\nInteresting cable.  Seems to convert from a VGA plug to an EGA plug.  That is,\n\tstandard nine-pin to VGA 15 pin. Made by Hewlett Packard.  Part No.\n\tD1181-80020\t\t~$10\n\n\n\nI've sold stuff like this before, and it was a huge success, with many \nsatisfied people trading or bartering stuff they didn't need anymore.  I \nusually ship through the U.S. Postal Service (haven't had any problems yet) \nand the shipping costs will be split or negotiated.\n\nWell, that's all folks.  As I said before, no offer will be refused.  If you \ncan convince me to give OCit to you instead of throwing it out, TRY!  I hate\nto throw away stuff...\n\n\n-Wayne\n\nwdempsey@athena.mit.edu\n(617)-225-9349\n\n\n\n"

AND while the Integra costs alot more, it is a\nbetter investment since it will hold its value considerably much better.  And\ndoes a nice job at being a sporty car and practical at the same time.\n\nNOTE: this isn't a flame on the GTZ, or other GM Quad 4 products.  THe Berreta\nis a nice car, and puts out respectable performance and a very reasonable\nprice not to mention, it has an Airbag.  But to start quoting figures from one\nsource, isn't too reliable.

This means that the car may\n\tnot have significant investment value but could be an excellent driver\n\tand or hobby car.  You will also want to get a copy of the Corvette\n\tBlack Book immediately.  Don't leave home (to look at Vettes) without it.\n\tSince you are contemplating spending >$20k, you might want to invest a\n\tfew hours in reading the \"Corvette Buyer's Guide\" and purchase Noland\n\tAdams' tape \"How to Buy a Corvette.\"  The tape shows you how to check\n\tfor damage, etc..  There are many many factors that will affect the\n\tvalue, road worthiness, and repair expense of your proposed 67.  The\n\tlist is much too long to go into here.

I have been\ninterested in buying a SHO for about five months and have been combing\nthe classifieds in Denver and Chicago every week.  I bought a\nremarkably clean maroon/red SHO with 92K miles on it for $6800.\nAs far as I can tell, this is about $2000 under Blue Book and I still\nhave another 8000 miles before the Extended Service Plan runs out.\n\n    As one should with any pre-1991 SHOs, I made sure that the car was\nalready refit with the upgraded clutch and pressure plate, as well as\nhaving been recalled for upgraded rotors and seatbelt attachments.\nHowever, my SHO does not have the newer rod shifter -- I understand I\ncan get this for $230 from any Ford service center.  In addition, the\ncar received the full tune-up at 60K miles, receiving new platinum\nplugs and valve adjustment.\n\n    For a car with 92K miles on it, the car was virtually immaculate.\nThe clearcoat paint job was devoid of any large chips or dents,\nalthough the front air-dam/molding was covered with lots of small\nscratches -- not surprising since most of the miles were spent on the\nhighway.\n\n    Having driven a smaller two-door coupe for so long, I was a bit\nconcerned about whether I could get used to driving a larger car.  To\nmy surprise, the size of the car doesn't bother me at all -- it seems\njust as nimble as my Celica!  (No comparisons with my Oldsmobile.  :-)\nVisibility from the driver's seat is excellent, helped mostly by of\nthe small the quarter-windows, aft of the back-seat door windows and\nin front of the C-pillar and rear window.  Parallel parking is a bit\nmore difficult, but other than that, I love the size.\n\n    In fact, I'm starting to appreciate the large trunk as I pack up\nfor a 14-hour drive to Washington, DC for the summer.  More on the\nride later in this review.\n\n\nEngine:\n    \n    As with anyone even slightly interested in SHOs, I was very\ninterested in the 24-valve 3.0L Yamaha \"Shogun\" engine.  I was not\ndisappointed.  Base performance of the engine under 4000 rpms is\ngood.  You can even do reasonable launches from second gear, although\nI don't make a practice of this.  The engine revs smoothly and eagerly\n-- tooling around town does not require many shifts.  This is good\nsince the shifter is definitely one of the weakest points of the car.\n(More on this later.)\n\n    While the performance of the engine under 4000 rpms may be\nunremarkable, it undergoes a Jekyll/Hyde transformation once you hit\nhigher revs.  At 4500 rpms, a butterfly valve opens and you can\nliterally hear and feel the geometry of the engine changing as twelve\nmore valves open up.  The engine soars to its 7000 rpm redline, and\nyou are treated to, in my opinion, the sweetest sounding V6 around.\nThe engine inexplicably sounds OVERJOYED to be at 6500 rpm!\n\n    I've noticed that when I drive around town, I constantly watch the\ntach to see how far below 4000 rpm I am.  To go from 2000 rpm to 4000,\nyou may have to punch the accelerator -- while torque is more than\nadequate, it doesn't come fully online until those other 12 valves\nare used.\n\n\nTransmission:\n\n    When _Car and Driver_ first reviewed the car in 1988, they\nmarvelled at how Ford had put such a wimpy clutch and balky shifter\ninto the car.  I remember driving a friend's parent's SHO in 1990, and\nremember thinking about whether I had the leg strength to drive the\ncar in traffic -- the clutch was that stiff.  That was back then.\n\n    The entire clutch assembly on my SHO has been replaced under a\nFord recall in 1991.  The clutch on the SHO feels no stiffer than the\none on my Toyota Celica.  In fact, the friction point seems a bit\nlarger and more forgiving.\n\n    When playing with the shifter with the car parked, the shifter\nfelt very reasonable.  The 1-2 and 3-4 gates were where you'd expect\nit to be, and the shifting action was smooth.  On the road, it's\nmuch the same -- but you have to shift SLOWLY!  Make no mistake, it's\na clumsy shifter.\n\n    When hurrying shifts, like when I was initially trying to impress\nfriends, I consistently miss the 1-2 shift, often grope clumsily for\nthe 2-3 shift, and sometimes even muff the 3-4 shift.  I find this\npretty amazing in a car like this.\n\n    It also took me several days to realize that you get the smoothest\nshifts when you take your time.  Seems obvious, but compared to my\nToyota and my friend's Honda, this seems atrocious and clumsy.\nSomeone on rec.autos noted that CRXs should blow SHOs off-the-line\nbecause of the incredibly clumsy shifter.\n\n    I now shift much more sedately, and the shifter seems more\nreasonable.  When you play within these bounds, the shifter works\nsmoothly with no surprises.  I don't know whether the rod shifter\nupgrade would help at all.\n\n    Along these same lines, I initially had trouble shifting gears\nsmoothly.  Again, slowing down the shifts and taking more care to\nmatch revs when letting out the clutch helped immensely.  This took\nseveral days for me to get the hang of.  (I think some of my problems\nwere because I've never had a car with enough power to balk at bad\nshifts in higher gears.)\n\n    Occasionally, I have trouble shifting into reverse.  The shifter\nrefuses to enter the gate, and I often grind the synchros trying to \nget it into gear.  I'll be watching this carefully in the next couple\nof months.\n\n    A quirk:  When I upshift and the engine drops back to 1000-2500\nrpm, I hear a whirring and then a grinding noise coming from the the\nengine compartment.  Not terribly loud, but the passenger can\ndefinitely hear it.  I asked about it when I was looking at the car,\nas do all my passengers.  Apparently, this is a definitely a \"SHO\nsound\" and is the gearbox -- apparently called \"gear rollover\".\nReplies to my queries on rec.autos are at the end of this review.\n\n\nExterior:\n\n    As I mentioned before, I am astounded by how well the body of this\nSHO has stood up.  Paint chipping on the front bumper and grille are\nvirtually non-existent.  Looking at how older Tauri sometimes\ndon't age so gracefully, I wonder what the guys at Ford did\ndifferently to the SHO bodies.\n\n    The body, in my opinion, is extremely attractive with matching\ncolor body moldings than the stock Tauri.  For some odd reason, the\nSHO seems different enough from vanilla Tauri to get stares at\nstoplights -- of course, this could be my overactive imagination.\n:-)  SHOs get fog lights, a more open grille, a completely\nmonochromatic exterior, and a deeper ground skirt in the back with\n\"SHO\" stenciled in relief.  I've seen a couple SHOs whose owners have\ncolored these in with florescent colors or in black.  Yuck.\n\n    I don't think the car is flashy.  I like it that way.  I feel\nalmost anonymous with all those Tauri out there, but different and\ndistinctive enough to those of us who care.  :-)\n\n\nInterior:\n\n    The interior is what really makes me feel like I don't deserve the\ncar.  The seats are grey leather, the steering wheel and shifter are\ncovered with black leather, and the entire instrument panel is done in\na black/grey/metallic scheme.  \n\n    The instrumentation is stock Taurus, except for the 140 mph speedo\nand 8000 rpm tach.  You get a center console with two cupholders, a\nlarge compartment under the radio (great for a CD player), an armrest\nthat contains yet another compartment, three appropriately sized coin\nholders for tollways (I think), and a compartment for holding\ncassette tapes.  There's map-holders in the doors, and an oddly small\nglove compartment.\n\n    I spilled a whole can of Coke in the cupholder and was delighted\nto find that the entire rubber holder can be removed and washed in a\nsink.  Hey, I'm really impressed with the ergonomics and\nthoughtfulness that went into its design.  And it's a 1989, before the\ninterior was upgraded!\n\n    The backseat is bigger than any car I've had.  Why do they need so\nmuch space?  :-)  (No smart-ass comments, please.  :-)\n\n    The driver and passenger seat have lumbar and side bolsters.  From\nwhat I hear, it's not uncommon for the side bolsters to show wear.\nMine is no exception.  The left side bolster on the driver's has\ncracked and I'm not convinced the right bolster is inflating all the\nway.\n\n    A big surprise for me:  I forgot that SHOs don't have a normal\nhand parking brake.  Instead, they have the regular parking brake that\nyou press with your left foot.  Too bad.  Again, I'm getting used to\nit, but it seems a bit anachronistic to me.\n\n\nRide:\n\n    The suspension is nice and stiff.  Too stiff?  It's stiffer than\nany car I've had.  A friend's new 1993 Toyota Celica ST seems tauter\nand is still able to soak up bumps better.  The SHO seems stiffer with\nless ability to soak up bumps.  Driving over railroad tracks is a\nnoisy and jarring affair.  On the other hand, taking turns feels\nwonderful because the body is so rigid and doesn't flex at all -- I\nlistened for that before I bought the car.\n\n    On the highway, the ride is great.  When I drove the car from\nChicago back to Purdue, I had trouble keeping under 85 mph, let alone\nfrom trying to see what 100 mph really feels like.  It's a relatively\nquiet ride, but the sunroof rattles.  I've tried to find out what\nexactly makes all the noise up there, but it seems to be the window\nthat rests on the rails.  No easy way to get rid of it, I think.\n\n    Over the past three days, I've oscillated between thinking the\nsuspension is wonderful and perfect and thinking that the ride is way\ntoo rough.  (Not for me, mind you.  But I wonder whether I would\nadvise my dad to buy one for himself.)  But, I've discovered, as with\nthe shifter, if you take your time with shifts, you'll have no reason\nto complain.  Let me explain...\n\n    The ride is worst when turning and applying lots of power to the\nwheels.  I feel the wheels scrabbling for traction and torque steer\nmaking the car skitter left and right.  After I understood this, I\navoid the limits of traction -- and I'm a happy camper again.\n\n    It's not body rigidity, but the composure of the car.\n\n    As if matching the suspension, the steering feel is quite heavy.\nMy first impression of driving my SHO was how hard you had to turn the\nwheel at highway speeds.  It tracks straight as an arrow, but when\ndriving around a parking lot, the high-effort steering didn't seem so\nuseful.  However, it's reasonable, but it doesn't communicate the road\nto the driver as well as a 1993 Ford Probe GT.  IMHO, it's much better\nthan the steering on my Celica ST.\n\n    I wonder how bad this car is during winter?\n\n\nMiscellaneous notes:\n\n    GRIPES:\n\n    The rattles from the sunroof is intermittent -- some days it rattles\n        loudly, other days I look up wondering where all the noise went.\n\n    Activating the sunroof is sometimes very noisy -- loud squealing as\n\tit retracts on its rails.  I wonder if there is a quick fix for this.\n\tAgain, other days it completely disappears.  (Function of humidity?)\n\n    Once I made the connection between the sometimes awful feeling suspension\n\tand torque steer, I've never complained about ride.\n\n    I wish the seats had more support under the thighs.  Also, I wish the\n\tside bolsters would close more tightly.  \n\n    I hear that tires for this car can get really expensive.  I\n\tcurrently have Goodyear GT+4s that cost the previous owner $500\n\tfor four.\n\n    I used to hate the Ford stereo systems -- whose idea was it\n\tto use a volume *paddle*?  Now, to my amazement, I don't\n\treally mind...  and sometimes think it's an okay idea!!!\n\tPretty ridiculous, though.\n\n    Getting up to 4000 rpm sometimes seems to be a chore.  But,\n\tthis is no big deal.  There is more than enough torque\n\tdown low.\n\n    I often goof up the shifting when driving with friends.  It\n\ttook me a couple of days before I could really shift\n\tsmoothly from 2nd to 3rd gear.  (Hard to believe, isn't it?)\n\n    My car has almost 93,000 miles on it.  My parents noted that\n\tit is almost impossible to find a low-mileage SHO. \n\tAstute observation, IMHO.  I wonder how long I can make\n\tmy SHO last -- I just bought a book titled \"Drive It Forever\"\n\tfor tips in this department.  :-)\n\n    The goofy parking brake pedal still throws me for a loop.  I once\n\tparked the car in gear, and then accidentally let out the clutch\n\tafter I started it.  The car jolted forward, and bounced off\n\tthe car in front of me -- no paint damage at all, but starting the car \n\tis a whole new ritual for me with that fangled pedal!  Also, I began \n\tto wonder how strong that brake really is.  (Today, I backed out of \n\tparking spot today and started to drive away before I noticed \n\tthe glowing brake light.  Oops.)\n\n    The driver's power window creaks when closed all the way.  The same\n    \tthing happens in my parents 1989 Mercury Sable.  Oddly, all the\n\tother windows work smoothly.\n\n\n    LIKES:\n\n    I'm liking the interior amenities more and more each day.  The\n    \tcupholders are great.\n\n    I didn't expect to use the keyless entry buttons so much, but\n\tit really is handy.  You can lock all the doors by\n\tpressing the 7/8 and 9/10 buttons together!  Neat!  And\n\tyou can never lock yourself out of the car.\n\n    I really feel like I don't deserve this car.  I really can't\n\tbelieve that I could afford it.  I got this car ten years \n\tahead of schedule.  :-)\n\n    I love this car so much that I've been telling my parents to\n\tlook into buying one.  I love this car so much that I\n\twrote this 13K file -- I meant to write a couple of lines\n\tand ended up with this.  \n\n    If there were a J.D. Powers Survey for used car owners, I would have\n\tan opportunity to express my incredible satisfaction of owning this \n\tcar.  I don't like thinking about getting another car, but at this\n\tpoint in time, I'm sure I'd buy another SHO.  For under $7000, you\n\tcan't beat it.  (Next time with an airbag and ABS, though.)\n\n    Insurance-wise, this car is also a big win.  I pay the same premiums\n\tas on my 1987 Toyota Celica -- despite that it has nearly twice\n\tthe horsepower.  \n\n\n\nOther Odds and Ends:\n\n    Much to my amazement, there is no SHO mailing list anywhere.\nMaybe because the _SHO Registry_ publication has filled this void.  I\nhaven't joined yet, but I've noticed that queries about SHOs still\nappear on rec.autos about once a month.  Owners of SHOs are always\nquick to respond, and are very vocal fans of the cars.  (Maybe some\nof the most vocal on rec.autos.  :-)\n\n    I've put together the responses to my questions about the cars, as\nwell as other posts with useful information on these cars.  I'll be \nposting this in the form of a FAQ soon.  \n\n    If anyone is interested in starting a mailing list, please speak up!\nI don't know if I have the resources here at Purdue to start one, but \nmaybe someone out there does.\n\n\nGene Kim\n(genek@mentor.cc.purdue.edu)\n\n\n"

I believed\nthis and to put it nicely, it was a piece of junk!\n\nI loved this car, I babied it, I pampered it, and after 2 years, it just\ncouldn't stay together, I would say that not everyone will have the\nproblems that I had, but know this, it's not just the car, it is the\nability to get the car fixed, which will NOT happen at any\nchrysler/dodge/take your pick dealer.  I don't care if there are going to\nreform their dealers/service with the intro of the LH cars, I will believe\nit when I see it.  Case and point, the local dodge dealer.  You drive up,\njust looking, you don't even get out of your door, when about 10 (yes 10)\nsalesman all eye you like their next meal, and literally pounce on you,\nand try to get you to make a deal, on everything your eye wanders towards.\nService is about 2 times worse than that.  I had an alignment problem, but\nthey tried to tell me that the K frame was bent, and about 2000 dollars of\nwork/parts to fix it.  Let me tell you the problems I had, and I took care\nof this car, I put alot of miles on it in the first couple years, but took\nit to every checkup it needed, and many that shouldn't have been.\n\n1988 Dodge Shadow ES\n\nThese were replaced within the 4 years that I owned the car.\n\nEngine \n4 Alternators\nRear Suspension Torsion Bar\n2 Water pumps\n5 thermostats\nHall effect sensor\nMain computer\n4 Batteries\n\nThese were rebuilt/repaired\n\nRadiator\nAutomatic Transmission\nPower Steering\n\n\nThose are just the things I can remember off the top of my head.  For\nabout a year before I sold the car, I said to myself, it's a good car, I\njust can't find anybody competent enough the fix it.  In the end, before I\ntraded it in for a Saturn, the power steering started acting up again.  I\njust stopped putting money into it.  I must have put at least $5000-$7000\nworth of repairs over it's lifetime.  I am sorry but Lee Iacocca can bite\nme.  Bullshit, whoever backs em best, is just afraid the stupid things are\ngoing to fall apart, and no one will buy them without assurance, why the\nhell do you think that LH has been nicknamed Last Hope.\n\nYou can do better, and I know people will disagree with me here, but\nJapanese, like Honda, or Toyota, or the only american car company that I\nfeel is a quality product, Saturn.  I will not touch another chrysler\nproduct again, no way.  I don't care how good the LH cars look good, and I\nwill admit they look promising, but not with the support that you get.  GM\nisn't much better, thank god, they don't control Saturn, like they do\ntheir divisions, or it would be just another marketing ploy.  \n\nDon't get me wrong, i will be watching my car (which I do like) like a\nhawk for the next 4 years.  I am much more hesitant to say it (or any) car\nis really good, until it has proved itself to me.\n\nBut since someone else pointed out C&D as a source.  I will note, because\nI used to read these magazines, that Car and Driver has never had a good\nthing to say about most Chrysler products (Shadow for one), always were\nthey moaning about the reguritated K-car, and engine.  Whereas Motor Trend\nalways thought they were great cars.  No car magazine is really objective.\n\nAnd although there are alot of people who don't like Consumers Reports, I\nwill use them to reinforce my argument (I already know about the big stink\nwith the Saturn crash tests, time will tell how good a car they are), the\nshadow/sundance rate much worse than average, in fact none of the\nchrysler's rate a better than average, I think the best one is just\naverage.  Excluding the diamond star/mitsubishi stuff and the LH's.  You\ncan find bad stuff about the Shadow.  Try as I might, when I researched\nthe Saturn, I could not find anything bad about it.  There is a great deal\nof information about this company, just because it is a new american\ncompany and it has created quite a stir in the automotive community, for\ngood reason.  Much more than the introduction of any new model lines of\nany established company.  I read an article, which had a sub-column, an I\nthink this imprinted on me more than anything else.  Some big wig in\nToyota said and I quote, \"We are watching them very closely.\"  Come on,\neverybody grow up, the foreign cars, especially the japanese have been\nkicking our butts, for good reason, the american car companies could not make\na good product or support the customer the way they want these days, to\nset in their ways, which is one of the reasons Saturn was created.  They\nare still struggling because they haven't learned yet.  They have the\nability, the workers are not inferior, the technology is not out of date,\nbut their attitude is, and they are just finding this out.  It's called\ncompetition gentleman/women if you don't satisfy the demand of the\nconsumer, well your out..  \n\n*asbestos suit on*\n\nGaia\n\n"

I am quite happy to\nreport now that on the S4, the Servotronic is *inoffensive*.  I\nsuppose that due to the fat gumball tires, the Servotronic has been\nloaded up more and this, so far has been the best implementation that\nI have tried.  It is far from perfect, mind you, and I'd be much\nhappier if it was an option that I could refuse, but on the S4, I no\nlonger consider this to be bad enough where I feel the entire car is\nruined.\n\nThe steering is still a tad too light, but it is accurate and I\nsuppose the stiffly sprung chassis sends back so much information that\nsome makes it through to the driver's hands.  So there is feel and\nthere is accuracy in the S4's steering.  But there is also room for\nimprovement.  I consider the S4's steering to be better than the\nJapanese competition, primarily because the Japanese do not believe in\n\"feel\" and engineer it out completely.\n\n\n2) Engine\n\nWheee! What a pressure cooker.  With just 110 miles on the clock I did\nnot expect the S4 to be producing anywhere close to what it will be\nputting out 10000 miles later, but still, the car packs a terrific\npunch.  For a turbocharged machine, it is very unusual in that it\nencourages lazy driving.  i.e. low revs, high gear.  It is so\nsupremely flexible that one could hardly believe that there's only 2.2\nliters of displacement to move this 3700 pound car around in such a\nfashion.  With maximum torque available at 1950 rpm and a 7200 rpm\nredline, the car can pretty much be left in third all day.. which\ntranslates to a speed range of something like 20-100 mph.  A\nchracteristic that one normally associates with large capacity V8s.\nThe technical achievement is breadthtaking.\n\nThrottle response is right up there with a good atmospheric engine. In\nfact, it would even put peaky multivalve engines to shame. Downshifts\nare almost unnecessary.  It is more fun to use the \"overboost\" feature\nthan to rev the engine.  For those not familiar, the S4 engine features\nup to 15 seconds of additional turbo boost for passing.  Sort of like\nlighting up the after burners in a jet fighter, one could, with the\nright foot only, in third gear, blast the car from 30 to 80 in just a\nfew moments.. simply by flooring the gas.  As far as the numbers go,\nmaximum torque available in overboost mode shoots up to about 270 lb\nft.. incredible for a 2.2 liter.  It takes a few moments for it to\ndevelop overboost but it is well worth waiting for.  Since this is quite\na heavy car, one's body parts are not flung around like say, the Corrado\nVR6.  The acceleration is smooth and strong, somewhat similar to riding\nin a jetliner as it accelerates down the runway on takeoff.  Also, one\nis treated to a very distinctive and entertaining whistle from the\nturbo.. the only entertaining sound to come out of a very\nrefined but bland sounding 5 banger..\n\nYes, Audi has refined the 5 to the point where at 7200 rpm it sounds as\nserene as it does at 2000.  The smoothness is outstanding, but not quite\nup to the standards of a very good 6, e.g. a 12 valve BMW.  I'd say that\nin terms of refinement, i.e. willingness to rev, smoothness, lack of\nharshness under full acceleration it is better than many V6s.  However,\nlost in the refinement process is the characteristic 5 cylinder bark\nthat made the older engines so characterful, if not terribly refined.\nThe 20 valve turbo 5 sounds pretty bland except for the whistle under\nfull boost.  Subjectively, I'd rate the VW VR6 engine as being far more\nmusical than the turbo 5.. Also, Audi's own V8 is also far more musical,\nwith a rorty race car growl when pressed,  though none of these can\nmatch its grunt.\n\nThe only hint of the engine's true capacity occurs when one is taking\noff from rest after the turbo has come to a near stop.  With the extra\ninertia from the permanently engaged 4wd system, one has to be somewhat\ndelicate in feeding in the clutch to prevent an embarassing stall. \nAlternately one could use more revs.. In both cases a very small price\nto pay for such a fantastic engine.  I think that Audi of America should\noffer an automatic option for this car, just as they offer (though in\nextremely small numbers) a 5 speed for the much peakier V8.  The\ncharacteristics of the engine are perfect for an automatic.  Ironically,\nin europe a slush is available but none is offered for the land of the\nslush.  Marketing twits rearing their ugly heads again...\n\n\n3) Chassis\n\nI've noticed that Audis tend to have very wide wheels and relatively\nmodest tire widths.  The car comes with Firestones of size 225/50 ZR16..\nwhich is not uncommon at all.  However, the very attractive 5 spoke\nwheels are no less than 8 inches wide, so there is no sidewall bulge\nwhatsoever.  Combined with the flared wheel arches, the S4 has a mouth\nwatering macho, yet subdued look. \n\nOn rough concrete, it becomes immediately clear that the new 100 body\nstyle has made significant advances in structural rigidity as well as\nroad noise suppression.. I suppose the two are inter-related, but I\ndigress.  To use a cliche, the S4's body feels like it has been carved\nout of stone.  Flex is totally undetectable, even when going over rough\nroads.  With a super rigid body like this stiff springs and stiff dampers\ndo not cause excessive harshness and while the S4's ride quality will\nnever worry a Lexus, it will also not draw comparisons to trucks or\npony cars.\n\nThe servotronic steering has already been mentioned.  I consider it to\nbe inoffensive because it did not inhibit spirited cornering.  I  was\nable to test the car's cornering powers without too much trepidation. I\nthink a new concept is at work in this car.  With its fat gumball tires,\ntalking about understeer or oversteer is practically meaningless.  On a\nbanked highway on ramp, I went in slow and started applying power as I\nwent around.  I could feel the g forces build to the point where the\nskin on my face was being tugged sideways.  Yet the car was totally and\ncompletely obedient to throttle and steering inputs.. It felt that the\nlimits were not even close to being approached.  The g forces were\nthrilling, but the entire affair of going around a curve is strangely\nuninvolving.  You tell the car what you want and it does it.  End of\nstory.  I think that I am starting to relate more and more to those\nreviewers who were highly impressed by the Honda NSX's clinical\nefficiency but were unable to fall in love with the car.\n\nThe brakes have a very good firmness to them and stop the car pretty\nwell too, though I've read that they are prone to fade.  I am not too\nsurprised, since the S4 does not have uprated brakes over the base Audi\n100 fwd. Harder pads would help, but that in turn would lead to a more\nwooden response when cold.  I am starting to see a trend among the\nluxury/sports sedan makers where extra weight is not being offset by\nadditional braking capacity.  The LS400's fade performance is nothing to\nbrag about; neither is the Q45's or the Legend's.  Brake fade these days\nseem to be a forgotten virtue when everybody's attention is focused on\nanti-lock capability.\n\n\n4) Comfort\n\nFor a car with such sporty abilities, its comfort levels are also\nexcellent.  The cabin is beautifully appointed, with carbon-fiber panel\ninserts in place of the wood trim of the '92 S4.  All the expected\ngizmos are there.. heated seats, power seats, seat memory, power this\nand that.  The glaring ommision was the trip computer, which was removed\nbecause Audi hasn't gotten it to work reliably yet.. That means that the\ncar has no boost gauge.  A real disappointment taking into account how\nmuch the turbo dominates its performance.  \n\nUnusual for the germans, the S4 comes with a Honda style moonroof, as\nwell as the very intelligent dial-a-sunroof-position rotary switch.\n\nNoise levels, including engine and tire noise is so low that I wouldn't\nconsider the Lexus' advantage in this area to be significant enough\nto sway a potential buyer.\n\n\n5) Conclusion\n\nEven though few will be able to afford an Audi S4 at its sticker price\nof $48K, the car is a bargain if one takes into account what it has to\noffer over the competition.  The 20 valve turbo 5 is a real gem, even if\nit doesn't produce Ferrari sounds.  No other luxury/sports sedan maker\noffers the utter security of quattro all wheel drive, which to some is\nworth the extra money all by itself.  The safety features are also \ntop notch.. 1994 side impact standard compliant, the very elegant \nautomatic seat belt tensioners and the dual airbags.  The 100 series\nAudis have been outstanding in government crash tests.  It gets my\nthumbs up for being so overwhelmingly capable rather than being\nall out exciting and intoxicating.\n\n\neliot\n\n"

I'd like to give some feedback based on\nreal life experince.  I keep the Valentine-1 in advanced logic mode\nand it rarely lights up as a Christmas tree.  The only time it does\nis when I am in the middle of a major shopping area and then it makes\nsense that is does since there are >= 8 sources coming from many different\ndirections.  I have found the Valentine-1 to be consistent in its\nreporting of bogeys regardless of any moving cars in the area.\n\nI have found the directional indication to be very useful.  In one case\nthere was two radar traps set up within one mile of each other.  As I\npassed the first radar trap, the direction indication changed.  Then\nthe detector was set off again pointing in the forward direction.  With\nother radar detectors I would have assumed that this was due to a reflection.\nBut with the Valentine-1 I knew there was a high probability that there\nwas another trap.  And there was!\n\nOn other occasions, the directional helped discern a false alarm from\na true alarm.  For example, as I pass a source, the direction indicator\nchanges.  The directional also allows me to focus my attention as to where\nthe signal might be coming from instead of having to look all over the \nplace.  When a car is approaching me from the rear with a detector\nthat leaks, I can tell that the signal is coming from the rear and as the\ncar passes me I can verify the source.  With other detectors, I would\nhave been unable to do this and would have had to assume that there was a radar\ntrap when there was none.\n\nI've had the Valentine-1 for several months now and find its added features\nto be useful and not gimmicks.\n\n                                       -Barry\n-- \n-----                                                                   --------\nBarry Frishberg                                             blf@apollo.ch.hp.com\nChelmsford-UK Expert Center                                      508/TN 436-4319\nChelmsford, MA                                                 \n"

(was Wanted: Advice on CB900C Purchase)\n\n--\n\nThanks to all of you who gave advice on the CB900 Custom. \n\nAs recommended, I had the bike compression tested.  Compression was\na little low, but very even across the four cylinders (+/- 5 psi).  They\nsaid that it was tested a little cold, so that would explain the low \nnumbers (around 90).  Does this sound right?  Otherwise, the bike looked\ngreat.  No signs of road rash, and no rust.  This bike looks great! \nIt is now in the shop getting tuned and new tires.  \nI am opting for the Metzler ME55 and ME33 tires (thanks to those \nwho posted this other thread).  This bike is _BIG_ compared to my other bikes.  \n( Sure is alot harder to load on a trailer than the KDX200 was. )  I should\nbe road legal tomorrow.  I am ignoring the afforementioned concerns about \nthe transmission and taking my chances.\n\nBeing a reletively new reader, I am quite impressed with all the usefull\ninfo available on this newsgroup.

I just installed a set of Bosch air horns ordered from \nDennis Kirk (pg. 282 of the latest catalog) on my '85 FJ1100. They are rated\nat 93db at 7 meters. I installed them using 10 gage wire from the battery to\nthe relay to the compressor to ground. My stock horn connectors fit the relay\npins just fine. I soldered the connections to the relay and compressor, and used\na crimp type battery connector and an inline 10amp fuse/connector from NAPA.\n\tI installed the compressor just forward of the fuse box in the front\nfairing by tie wrapping between the steering head frame and the black steel tube\nframe used to support the front fairing. You have to remove the front fairing to\ndo this, but it fits outside of the frame but inside the fairing on the two\nvertical supports just in front of the fuses. Depending how tight your fairing\nfollows the frame, you should be able to fit it somewhere in the fairing.\nThe compressor is about 2\" in diameter and about 5\" long.\n\tThe relay mounted on the front of the steering head frame (it is small\nso there should be plenty of good places for it.\n\tI found a perfect place for the horns that required only tie wraps to\nmount. The horns fit inside the front fairing/frame and stick out on either side\njust in front of the air scoops, but behind the turn signals. The back of the\nhorns point back towards the center of the bike and come real close to where\nthe gas tank connects to the front part of the frame. There is just enough\nroom to the outside to allow full lock to lock clearance, and there are nice\ncut outs in the frame for the back of the horn to go into.\n\tThe short horn is even with the fairing, and the long one sticks out\nabout an inch or so, but it is really not that noticable unless you look\nclosely. They end up pointing down slightly and maybe 30 degrees from straight\nahead (perfect for those cagers trying to change lanes into you).\n\tIf you have any other questions about the mounting, email, and I can try\nto explain better. If your bike is not red, then you may want to paint them\nfirst.\n\tHow do they work you ask? They are very, very, very *LOUD*. They sound\nmore like a european sports car than a truck, but a vast improvement over stock.\nI have used them at least daily since installing them, and the 10 amp fuse has\nnot blown yet (although, the duration of the horn blasts have been short).\n\tI've repeatedly scared the shit out of my friends with them, even though\nthey know that I have the horns, they still jump. They are perfect for keeping\nthe pedestrians on the sidewalk.\nThe bottom line is they work, are loud enough to cause pain and suffering to\nthose stupid lane changing cages (as well as take a few years off their lives)\nand are relatively easy to install on the FJ. YMMV.\n\n-TJK\n'85 FJ1100 with \"GET OUT OF MY WAY\" horns.\n\"That looks like a suit you'd fight a fire in\" -comment about the Aerostich\n"

Kinda Offical...\n\n\nYo, Whaz up!!!\n\nEarlier, I was reading on the net about using Splitfire plugs.  One\nguy was thinking about it and almost everybody shot him to hell.  Well,\nI saw one think that someone said about \"Show me a team that used Split-\nfires....\"  Well, here's some additional insight and some theories\nabout splitfire plugs and how they boost us as oppossed to cages.\n\nSplitfires were originally made to burn fuel more efficiently and\nincreased power for the 4x4 cages.  Well, for these guys, splitfires\nincreased performance by increasing TORQUE.  They weren't focusing\non horsepower numbers.\n\nNow how does this related to us high performance pilots?  Well, that\ndepends.  Do you pilot a high performance 2- or 4-cylinder machine?\nIn the case of 4-cylinders, splitfires would increase overall torque,\nbut 4's make more top end horsepower with its torque packed down low.\nSo for 4's, splitfires would not significantly increase power.\n\nBut what about twins?...  Many of you 4 guys laugh at some of us twins,\nbut many times we carry less weight which sometimes can make up for\nthe hp loss (see Doug Polen vs. Scott Russell, Daytona 1992).  However,\ntwins make more torque thoughout their powerbands.   So how does this\ntranslate?  Increased torque should \"theoretically\" help twins make\nmore power.  Splitfire claims that there should be not extra mods\nor anything made, just stick 'em in.\n\nNow I don't know about all of this (and I'm trying to catch up with\nsomebody about it now), but Splitfires should help twins more than\n4's.        \n\nAs far as racing teams....  Ducati team \"Fast by Ferraci\" used\nsplitfires in the 1989 season (this is when they had Jamie James\nrunning for em), but I don't know why they stopped since then.\nAlso, somebody check to see if they had them in 88.....\n\nPeace.\n\nWarren\nwcd82671@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu\n\"Have Suzuki, will travel...\"\n\nAt a local \"fix-er-up-er\" shop, the bike repairest looked at a\ndumped ZX-7.

Was\nDS>that the one with the little illuminated Dragon's Head on the front\nDS>fender, a style later copied by Indian, and the round side covers?\n\nNo. Not at all. The Viking was a trick little unit made way back when\n(forties? fifties?) when Spag was trying to make a go of it in racing.\nThe first iteration (the Springer) was a boxer twin, very similar to Max\nFriz's famous design, but with an overhead \"point cam\" (see below for\nmore on the valvetrain). The problem was that the thing had no ground\nclearance whatsoever. The solution was to curve the cylinder bores, so\nthat the ground clearance was substantially increased:\n\n\n      ==@==   <-Springer motor (front)\n                 Viking motor (front) ->   \\=@=/\n\nThis is roughly the idea, except that the bores were gradually curved\naround a radius, as the pistons were loath to make a sharp-angled turn\nin the middle of their stroke. The engine also had curved connecting\nrods to accomodate the stroke.\n\nThe engine stuck out so far because of its revolutionary (and still\nunique) overhead cam system. Through the use of clever valve timing and\nand extrordinarily trick valve linkage, only a single cam lobe was\nrequired to drive both overhead valves.\n\nJust as revolutionary was the hydraulic valve actuation, which used a\npressurized stream of oil to power the \"waterwheel\" which kept the lobe\nspinning over. One side effect that required some rather brutal\nengineering fixes was that until the engine's oil pressure came up to\nnormal, the engine's valve timing would be more or less random,\nresulting in some impressive start-up valve damage. The solution was a\nlittle hand crank that pressurized the cases before you started the\nbeast, remarkably similar to the system used in new Porsches to\npressurize the oil system before the car is started (the cage, however,\nuses an electric oil pump. Wimps).\n\nDespite this fix, the engine had a nasty propensity for explosively\nfiring its valves into the pistons when a cylinder would temporarily\nlose a bit of oil pressure in a corner. The solution was to run even\nhigher oil pressures and change the gaskets and seals regularly. This\nwas feasible because it was a racing engine.\n\nWith just a single overhead lobe, and no pushrod/shaft/chain towers\nbecause of the hydraulic system, the head of the engine came to an\nalmost perfect point:\n\n                    /\\\n                   /()\\   <-lobe\n                  / XX \\  <-complex linkage (not shown due to\n valvestems ->   / \\  / \\    complexity)\n                |  |   | |\n                |  |===| |\n                    =0=  <---piston\n                     |\n                             Note that the tip was not truly vertical\n                             (it was at about a 70 degree angle to the\n                             ground, and this drawing doesn't show the\n                             curvature because there was none in the\n                             head itself. The bore curve would start\n                             about where the cylinder bore disappears in\n                             this diagram\n\n\nThe effect of the pointy heads on top of a pair of gently (pundits of\nthe day even said sensuously) curved cylinders was much like a pair of\nfinned Viking horns poking out from beneath the gas tank. Thus, the\nname.\n\nThe Vik was a moderately successful racer, lightning fast when it\nworked, but plagued by problems relating to its revolutionary\ntechnology. Eventually, it was dumped when Spag finally realized that\nracing was not where the Spagthorpe name would be made. The machines\nwere raced for another year or two by privateers, and their fate\n(approximately six Vikings were made, plus one or possibly two\nSpringers. Confusing the issue is one old Spag staffer who swears up and\ndown that this machine was tooled for production, and that as many as\ntwenty or thirty machines may have come off the line. However, no modern\nrecord of a production Viking has survived, and most motorcycle\nhistorians discount this story.\n\nRyan Cousinetc.|1982 Yamaha Vision XZ550 -Black Pig of Inverness|Live to Ride\nKotRB          |1958 AJS 500 C/S -King Rat                      |to Work to\nDoD# 0863      |I'd be a squid if I could afford the bike...    |Flame to\nryan.cousineau@compdyn.questor.org  |   Vancouver, BC, Canada   |Live . . .\n\n\n * SLMR 2.1a * If you aren't sliding, you aren't riding.\n                                                                                                          \n----\n+===============================================================+\n|COMPUTER DYNAMICS BBS    604-255-9937(HST)    604-986-9937(V32)|\n|Vancouver, BC, Canada -  Easy Access, Low Rates, Friendly Sysop|\n+===============================================================+\n"

The RoadRacing Digest is mailed out \n whenever it contains enough interesting content. Given the\n frequency of postings this appears to be about every other\n day.\n\n Should you wish to receive the list via digest (once every \n 30-40K or so), please send a subscription request to:\n\n\n        digest-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM\n\n\n HOW TO POST TO THE LIST\n -----------------------\n\n This is an open forum. To post an article to the list, send to:\n\n\n        race@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM\n\n\n Depending on how mail is set up at your site you may or may\n not see the mail that you have posted. If you want to see it\n (though this isn't necessarily a guarantee that it went out)\n you can include a \"metoo\" line in your .mailrc file (on UNIX\n based mail systems). \n\n BOUNCES\n -------\n\n Because I haven't had the time (or the inclination to replace\n the list distribution mechanism) we still have a problem with\n bounces returning to the poster of a message. Occasionally,\n sites or users go off-line (either leaving their place of\n employment prematurely or hardware problems) and you will receive\n bounces from the race list. Check the headers carefully, and\n if you find that the bounce originated at Sun (from whence I\n administer this list) contact me through my administration\n hat (race-request@boogie.EBay.sun.com).

No offense, Bill, I\ndon't mean to say that you're not being straight, but I wonder how you\nknow about this?  Have you actually every used your secret method to break\nall the different kinds of bike locks?  Or are you taking someone's word\nfor it?\n\nThe fact is, it is unlikely that someone reading anything here is going to\ngo into a successful bike-stealing business because they read anything in\nrec.motorcycles.  So please tell us what you are talking about.  We can't\neven protect against an assault, or discuss methods, if you don't come out\nwith it.\n\nSee, I have heard the ones about the pipes, and the liquid nitrogen, and the\ncordless Dremel tools, and a bunch of other ones.  The most plausable method\n(I am not a bike thief, so I really don't know for certain) is just to put\na rod through each wheel, and use four guys to just lift the bike into a\ntruck.  This works because most people don't lock their bikes TO anything.\nSince that method is so childishly easy, I figure a nice, visible chain or\ncable locking the bike to something is likely to make a lazy thief go on\nto the next bike.\n\n(Hey, finally an advantage to the weight and high CG of the Concours!  :-)\n\n|Especially since I have a bike that I would hate to see ripped off\n|by such a trival tactic. WARNING NO lock alone is a safe deterent against theft,\n|the thief doesnt need to be a locksmith or a lock-picker to walk away with your\n|property!  I personally think motion alarms in combination to a lock\n|of this type is the way to go if in fact you are that concerned.\n\nWhat tactic are you referring to?  If we don't know what you are talking about,\nwe can't very well guard against it, can we?\n\nFor my money (literally) I rely on a combination of a motion-detector alarm\nwith pager when I'm out of earshot of the bike in a questionable area, C&C\ninsurance, and I try to park in obvious, visible areas with lots of people\nabout.  (See, if someone just plays with the bike without intention of\nstealing it, at least some eyes are on it, and if they get too rambunctious,\nthey'll set off the alarm.)\n\nThat's for a nice bike.  For a ratbike, the trick is to always keep its\nactual value well below blue-book, so that it looks so crappy nobody would\nWANT to steal it, and even if they were stupid enough to, you would make\na profit on the deal.  :-)\n\nSeriously, if I (for instance) need to go on a business trip for a week,\nand (sadly) have to leave the bikes sitting, they both get a shitty-looking,\nbut useable cover, locked on, and both bikes locked to each other and a\ncurb bumper in the parking lot under the light.  I usually rig the cable\nlocks I use (aircraft cable) so that if anyone pulls on either bike or\nthe cable joining them, the Concours alarm goes off.  And I have a friend\ncome buy every day to have a look and make sure they're still there.  The\nonly thing I have ever had stolen was a $60 cover, and that was over \nwinter storage, with the battery out of the bike (and thus no alarm).\n\nOh, put your own eyelets into the cover for the locks to pass through, and\nplace them so that they have to absolutely destroy the cover to get it off.\n\nThat's the best that I can think of.  Most of the locks I see people put\non bikes look, well, not too mechanically sound.  I like ABUS, since I have\npersonally removed Master locks from lockers with my boot.\n\nDave Svoboda (svoboda@void.rtsg.mot.com)    | \"I'm getting tired of\n90 Concours 1000 (Mmmmmmmmmm!)              |  beating you up, Dave.\n84 RZ 350 (Ring Ding) (Woops!)              |  You never learn.\"\nAMA 583905  DoD #0330  COG 939  (Chicago)   |  -- Beth \"Bruiser\" Dixon\n"

                    "content": "From: edw@boi.hp.com (Edward Walsh)\nSubject: Guzzi 850-T tires, plus fairing question\n\n\n\n\nI have a question about tires for my Guzzi. It is a '75 850-T. The tires that\nwere on it when I just bought it are old and cracked. I do not have an\nowners manual for it (yet), but the tires listed in the Haynes manual are:\nFront, 3,50 H 18 ; Rear 4.10 H 18, and pressures recommended are 26 front and\n33 rear. Oddly, the pressure for the same tire on the T-3 is listed at 29 psi\ninstead. Anyone know the reason? As I know though, the pressure I should run\nat is that recommended by the manufacturer of the new tires I purchase.\n\nThe real question I have is this. The old tires that are on the bike are for\nthe front, a Metzler Touring Special, 4.10 H 18, and for the rear an Avon\nRoadrunner 4.70 H 18, (120/90) H 18 as marked on each tire. Both are larger\nthan that listed in the Haynes Manual. What does the owners manual recommend,\nand was it common to go up one size for this bike? Also, this will be my first\nmotorcycle with innertubes. Any comments on the various manufacturers inner\ntube qualities?\n\nThe above sizes are inches (except for the additional mark on the current\nrear tire). What is the best metric match? The local BMW dealer thought\n100/90 H 18 on the front and 120/90 H 18 on the back. He also happens to be\nvery good at getting close to matching mail order prices.\n\nI am thinking of going with a Metzler ME33 Laser (possibly Comp K) on the\nfront and ME88 on the back, both in MBS variety if possible (the longer \nlasting belting system). I already use the ME33 on both the Vision and\nFJ for the front, and like it, and I thought that with the shaft drive\nbehavior and torque from the Guzzi that the ME88 might give more predictable\nback end control and sliding behavior than a ME55 might, as well as giving\nmuch better tire milage life. Any comments?\n\nA friend told me he thought that my bike had Boranni rims which are very\ngood, but are relatively soft and have delicate sidewalls. I do not wish to\nmount the tires myself this first time, so aside from warning the shop to be\ncareful, any other comments I should make? I havn't looked at the rim to\ncheck out the make yet, if it is marked. He just told me late yesterday and\nI havn't had a chance to check the rim type.\n\nOn another note. I will remove the ugly (but in good shape....anyone want it?)\nVetter fairing, and I will run without a windscreen for a while, but eventually\nI would like a simple rounded cafe' style quarter fairing for it. It could be\nfork/handlebar mounted. Any suggestions? Is there such a thing as a frame\nmounted quarter fairing of the cafe' style for this bike? How about lower\nbars/clip-ons for it? I would like to restore the bike into a good condition\nrunner with a few modern updates, but while not being historically exactly\naccurate still have it reflect relatively well a representation of the cafe'\nstyle. (Yes I know to be picky, that period really predates this bike....it is\njust that this bike has such potential for _that_ look.)\n\n-----------------------------Edward Walsh----Hewlett-Packard Company-------\n                             edw@boi.hp.com  Disk Memory Division, MS475\n                             (208)323-2174   P.O.

My top is a 46L and the bottom is a 48L.  For the\nbottom, the waist is far too large, but the thighs fit just right (the\n46 had a better waist, but cut off the circulation in my legs, I have\nlarge, muscular thighs, and no, I didn't use the thighmaster to get\nthem :-).  The jacket fits me ok in the chest, slightly snug at the\nwaist, and too small in the arms.  I can't imagine finding a one-piece\nsize that would have fit correctly, as even the 2 piece has it's\nproblems (strange, since my V-Pilot jacket fits great all over, and\nwhen I tried the matching pants, they fit like a glove as well).\n\nI can only assume the models Aero Design uses to design its suits are\nin some way different from us real folks.\n\nAlso, even though it's related to convienience, you look pretty damn\nwierd walking around with the tops and bottoms while running errands.\nI've gotten some really suspicious looks, and sweated a lot while in a\nstore wearing the whole suit, since you can't fit the top and bottom\nin any motorcycle storage device yet devised (except the trunk in my\nsidecar rig :-).  With the two piece, I unzip the pants (I generally\nleave the two pieces zipped together, primarily because the pants fall\ndown unless I pull the cheesy elastic belt-type band real tight),\nstuff them in one of my spacious BMW saddlebags (the pants just fit),\nand run errands just wearing the jacket.  Actually, if I know I'll be\nrunning errands, I just wear my V-Pilot jacket, but that's just me...\n\nAs far as crash protection, I'd say that both suits are probably\nequal.  It seems that for weather protection, if anything the 2 piece\nprovides a little more because of the jacket overlapping the pants by\n3 inches.  The 2 piece is probably a little less comfortable around\nthe waist, just because of the extra layer of stuff, but maybe not.\n\nSo I'd have to vote for the two piece.  Despite the slightly odd fit,\nI still find the suit the most versatile piece of riding clothing I\nown.

Not when you stop at a STOP\nsign, not when she thinks you're gonna crash, never. Keep them on the\npegs until you tell her to get off the bike.\n\nb) She is to hold onto your waist. She should hold on tightly enough\nthat she won't slide off the bike if you twist the throttle a bit. And\n(added bonus for you here), she should keep as close to your butt as\npossible so quick stops don't make her slide into you and knock your\nballs up onto the gas tank. You decide how best to word this.\n\nc) Just stay perpendicular to the bike; straight up in the seat. Don't\nlean your body into curves, just go with the bike and stay perpendicular.\nDon't look over your shoulder.*\n\n3) Remember at all times that you have a passenger on the back. That\nmeans don't pop the clutch, and try to corner and stop smoother than\nusual. Be aware that if you jump on the brake, you're going to have\nthe equivalent of a 100 lb. dead weight crashing into you from behind,\nso be prepared for that.\n\n4) Make sure she pisses before the ride even if she says she doesn't\nhave to go. No anti-women stuff here; I have a tiny bladder myself.\n\n5) Remind her to look around while you're riding. Point to things\nof interest. It makes the ride more enjoyable to her (she won't get\nso focused on just looking at the back of your helmet), and it gives\nher ample excuse to squeeze you to show she saw what you pointed at.\n\n* My wife and I tried the MSF-recommended \"look over the rider's\nshoulder in curves\" bit, and it just didn't work. The timing of\nher weight shift was unpredictable (especially on the Maxim because,\nunlike the Ninja, the upright riding position really restricts the\npillion's view of the road ahead).

One Friday, one Saturday, and a good-old Sunday doubleheader.\n\"What could be better,\" declared Ernie Banks.  Perhaps the fact that the Cubs\nare challenging?\n     \"It's pitching, it's always been pitching that we've lacked,\" announced\nRyne Sandberg.  \"If we can get by Brewer, then beat Carlton, Alexander, or\nBunning - preferrably 2 of the last three - we'll know we might be able to\nwin.\n     \"Lord, I hope we pull it off.\"\n     The Phils scored once in the top of the first; Richie Ashburn singled, Pete\nRose followed with a hit, sending Ashburn around second.  Kiki Cuyler cut\nthe ball off in left center, and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks, who threw\nto Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third.  Rose went to second on the play.\n     Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center, moving Pete Rose to\nthird.  Schmidt was walked - the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let him\nbeat them.  Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130-150 walks this\nyear.  Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well, and he lashed a double into a\ngap in right-center.  \"Cool Papa\" Bell's speed allowed him to cut the ball off\nand prevent Schmidt from scoring.  Nellie Fox was walked, and Bob Boone\ngrounded out to second, ending the threat.  \n     \"Teams are starting to realize that you don't have to pitch to Schmidt or\nTorrienti, and that is lowering their run total.  It puts a lot of pressure on\nKlein and Dick Allen (who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spells\nRose at first), and it's a credit to the Phillies that they've been able to\nsustain their pace.  The picthers have slumped at times.\"  So came the\nanalysis from Frank Chance.\n     The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit, Thomas' grounder\nmoved him to second, and - after Sandberg made out - Billy Williams singled\nhome a run.  In the sixth, Ron Santo launched a two-run homer to make it\n3-1.  Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth, as Schmidt singled and Klein\nsingled him to third.  Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox, but Dick Allen popped\nout of the dugout to hit.  Allen doubled to right, but luckily for the Cubs,\nWilliams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense.\nHe fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third.  Lance Parrish, hitting\nfor Boone, was walked, and Bruce Sutter entered.  Larry Bowa grounded into\na 1-2-3 double play, but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch-hitter.  Desiring a\nstrikeout, since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick\nTrillo pinch-running at third, Chance brought in Lee Smith, who induced a\npop-up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder, ending the inning.  The\nCubs took the win, 3-2, moving a game behind the Phillies.\n     Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3-Finger Brown Saturday.  To get\nanother righthander in the lineup, Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlock\nplayed third.  Unfortunately, Brown allowed six doubles, and the Cub bullpen\nwas worn down even more, as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead against\nLefty.  Madlock, batting sixth, had knocked two doubles of his own, driving\nhome four runs.  Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs, and Cuyler added\nanother, and the score was 8-6, Cubs after six innings.  The Phillie bullpen\nhad more troubles in the bottom of the eighth, as the Cubs grabbed 3 more\nruns to ice an 11-7 triumph.\n     Sunday's twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at one\npoint, including a rare outside-the-park home run in the second game, off\nRobin Roberts.  Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest, 4-2, but\nthe Cubs captured the second one 5-4, with Waddell gaining the win.  Bruce\nSutter tossed two innings for the save, though he allowed one run in the\neighth.  The Cardinals stood half a game behind these co-leaders, and would\nconclude their series with the Expos on Monday.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Montreal at St. Louis(August 3-6): 3-way tie for 1st\n     Dennis Martinez is on a roll, and he continued it versus John Tudor Friday.\nThe Expos have a wide variety of hitters, and - while they aren't among the\nall-time greats, they are getting the job done.  After winning their first\nfirst two games, they suddenly found themselves only 2 1/2 games out of\nfirst in this wacky season.\n     Martinez triumphed 5-3 on Friday, and WIlliams outdueled Dizzy Dean 3-2\nSaturday.  However, the Cardinals refused to give up, winning 6-2 on Sunday.\nThe Cards captured Monday's game, too, as Steve Carlton outdueled Steve\nRogers 3-2.  \"We're really good against ground ball pitchers because of our\nteam speed,\" remarked Lou Brock.  \"I don't see why we can't win this\ndivision.\"\n     The Phillies and Cubs may have some reasons for them.  Two-thirds of\nthe way through the season, there is a 3-way tie for first.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n     New York at Pittsburgh(August 3-6): 3 straight 3-2 wins for Bucs,\nnow 2 back - but in 4th!\n    \"When your team is in a slump like we are, the worst thing is to play in a\npitcher's park like this,\" spoke Gil Hodges before the series.  Keith\nHernandez added that \"their defense takes away quite a few runs per year,\nand it must be giving them an extra 6-7 wins.\"  The Pirates have made only\n26 errors all season, 6 ahead of the second place Dodgers.  Error totals tend\nto be around 50 for the best defensive All-Time teams.\n     Rube Foster defeated Sid Fernandez 5-2 Friday, and Candelaria outshone\nSeaver 3-2 Saturday, in a game featuring some outstanding defense.  When\nNolan Ryan and two relivers 6-hit the Mets in another 3-2 win Sunday, the\nPirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the\n.500 mark.  They had been unable to several times in the past month.  Bert\nBlyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game.  Both pitchers possessed\nfantastic stuff, and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home\nruns - a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two-run blast by Ralph\nKiner for the Pirates.  The Mets' Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in the\ntop of the ninth off Jesse Orosco, working his second inning, after Mookie\nWilson pinch-ran for Gary Carter at second.  With one out and a runner on\nfirst, Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch-hit.  The Pirates countered with Kent\nTekulve, placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds in\nleft field as the ninth place hitter.  Tekulve induced a groundout forcing\nStrawberry at second.  He slid hard into Honus Wagner, preventing the\nPirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon.  Tekulve\nallowed a hit, but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the right\nfield line, ending the inning.  Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers, who entered\nto pitch the eighth, and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deep\ncenter, running through the stop sign at third to score an inside-the-park\nhomer to win.  The Pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3-2 wins,\nand had moved to within 2 games of first place, with seven weeks to go.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n     San Francisco at Boswaukta(August 3-5): \n    Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule, as the Giants\nmanaged to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting\npitching that just wouldn't tire.  In fact, reported manager John McGraw,\n\"once this rough part of the schedule is over, maybe as early as this coming\nweek, we may shift to a 4-man rotation again for a little while.\"\n     Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday, beating Lew Burdette and\nthe Braves 4-1.  Willie Mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits.  Rick Reuschel\nfaced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest.  The Braves' park had been a homer\nhaven, but this took the cake, as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16-13.\nWillie Mays had three homers, Willie McCovey, Eddie Matthews, and Don\nBaylor had two, and Hank Aaron, Ernie Lombardi, Biz Mackey, and Mel Ott had\none each.  The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sunday's\ndoubleheader, putting them on a pace for 223, which would be 4 short of the\nNational League record.  They were still a tad behind the '61 Yankees' pace.\nThey had allowed over 120, though.  Vida Blue actually got the win after\nretiring 2 batters in the fifth.  He allowed only a run in the sixth, but\nfaltered in the seventh.  Joe McGinnity earned the save.\n     In the doubleheader, the Braves' Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the\nfirst game, but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as the\nBraves won, 4-3.  The Giants took the second game, however, by a 6-2 score.\nThe homer by Aaron was a magical #150 by the Braves; however, they fell to\nthree game below .500, making a comeback extremely unlikely.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n     San Diego at Cincinnati(Aug. 3-5):  Randy Jones faced Ewell\nBlackwell in the first of this 3-game series, and the Padres felt rather\ngood.  With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game, the\ntrade looked even better.  McGriff's batting average was even rising.  Of\ncourse, the bench was very poor, and Joe Gordon was only adequate in the\noutfield, but these were minor problems, since the pitching was holding up.\n     Jones pitched a good game Friday, and won 6-3.  McGriff launched two\nhome runs.  Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and Ray\nNarleski Saturday; 5-4 was the final score.  Tom Candiotti battled Satchel\nPaige to a 3-3 tie through eight innings before departing.  The game was\nscoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth.  Paige had departed after\n10, and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning.  Tom Browning was working\nhis second scoreless inning, when Dave Winfield doubled with one out and\nJoe Gordon was pitched around.  Thurm Munson doubled both runners home,\nand the Padres gamed a 5-3 win.  The three-game sweep had pulled the\nGiants into a tie with the Reds.  Though the Reds denied it, the highly\nemotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Brookangeles at Houston(August 3-5):\n     Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the\nwide open plains of the Astrodome.  The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill in\nthe first game, opposite Don Drysdale.  \"Normally,\" Drysdale remarked, \"I\nwould be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them.  I can't afford\nto with this team, though; we have to get our own runners going; we can't\nafford to let the Astros beat us.\"  He then winked and said: \"Well, maybe\nDavis will get decked once.\"\n     The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six (!) is\nprimarily why he would be decked, but it should be understood that his\ncurrent pace would give him nine for the season.  The hitting on this team is\na little better, but the power is all doubles and triples.  Still, Carl Furillo is\nthe main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend, as he threw\ntwo runners out trying for inside-the-park homers.  For those unaware of\nthe nastness of the Astros' park, they have a 23-foot high gray wall all\naround the outfield; balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs.  The\nfoul poles are 355 feet from home plate, but the alleys are 400 feet away,\nwith center field at 420 feet.  \"It's as if some three-year-old threw a\ntantrum and told his playmates: 'If I can't hit home runs, nobody will hit\nhome runs',\" remarked Roy Campanella.\n     The Dodgers stole five bases Friday, but the Astros decided to revitalize\nthe Baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before; for tonight, anyway,\nDavis, Jim Wynn, and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings,\naccording to the manager.  After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via the\nBaltimore chop, Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch.  He responded with\na two-run double, but Wynn - playing first for Davis - popped up, and the\nAstros didn't score any more in that inning.  They did score 3 in the fourth to\nerase a 3-2 deficit, and the Astros wound up winning 6-4.  They threatened\nto do even better the next game, as Tommy John would be their opponent.\nWalt Alston met privately with the starters at 6 A.M. before the game.\n     \"I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop,\" he explained.\n     \"How can we do that,\" Pee Wee Reese wondered.\n     \"They're going to be beating the ball down, so we've got to be ready to\nthrow on the run.  Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt, but I\nwant all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws.  We'll go with\na shallow infield almost the whole time.\"\n     The plan almost worked.  Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eight\ninnings, but the Astros got three; two of them scored when Bill Doran\npushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and\nthird.  3-2 Astros was the final, with Dave Smith earning another save.  The\nDodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday, as Nolan\nRyan walked five, three of whom scored in a 4-1 Dodger win.  Fernando\nValenzuela lost the second game 4-2 to Don Sutton, however, as the Dodgers'\nthirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough.\n     \"We're mostly a power team,\" remarked Ron Cey.  \"Jackie and, when he\nplays, Maury Wills are our only real speed demons, though a couple other\nplays can do it now and then.  We're sunk in a place like the Astrodome.  I\nguess that's why they're so successful there.\"  Indeed, it seems that\nbasestealing teams give them the most trouble in the dome.  The 'Stros\nswiped 12 bases in 16 attempts, giving them 230 on the season.\n     Standings after these weekend series:\nA.L.East\nTeam                     W           L           GB\nNew York                68        42          --\nCleveland               65        46          3.5\nDetroit                 64        46           4\nBoston                  64        47          4.5\nBaltimore               59        52         9.5\nToronto                 43         69        25.5\nWashington              39         73          28\n\nA.L.West\nOaksaselphia            63         48          --\nMinnesota               61         48            1\nChicago                 59         53          4.5\nKansas City             57         54          6.5\nCalifornia              57         56            8\nMilwaukee               45         66           17\nSeattle                 32         78         31.5\n\nN.L.East\nChicago          57         53                --\nPhiladelphia     58         54                --\nSt. Louis        58         54                --\nPittsburgh       56         56                2\nMontreal         53         56               3.5\nNew York         48         64               10\n\nN.L.West\nBrookangeles     66          46               --\nCincinnati       66           47              0.5\nSan Francisco    65          46               0.5\nBoswaukta        54           56               11\nHouston          50          61               17.5\nSan Diego        36          75                29.5\n-- \nDoug Fowler: dxf12@po.CWRU.edu  : Me, age 4 & now: \"Mommys and Daddys & other\n    Ever wonder if, after Casey : relatives have to give lots of hugs & love\nmissed the 3rd strike in the poem: & support, 'cause Heaven is just a great\nhe ran to first and made it?     : big hug that lasts forever and ever!!!\"\n"

About the only tangible thing we can look at is\nopponent's SB%, and that's clouded by how well your pitchers hold runners.\nCatchers ERA is a possibility, but it's subject to way too many biases. \n\n  As for them 'playing on a team that is not so much in need of another big\nbat', I disagree here too. About the only chink in the Braves' armor is that\nthey're weak offensively at several positions (CF, C, 2B, SS if Belliard\nplays, 1B unless Bream and Hunter form another super-platoon) and very weak \ndefensively if Blauser plays. I'd like to see the Braves give at least one of\nMel Nieves, Javy Lopez or Chipper Jones a shot, but much like the talent-rich\nJays of recent years they'll be conservative and stick with what they have. \nI'm not saying that's wrong, just conservative. \n \n-- \nDave Hung Like a Jim Acker Slider Kirsch      Blue Jays - Do it again in '93 \nkirsch@staff.tc.umn.edu                        New .. quotes out of context!\n\"Not to beat a dead horse, but it's been a couple o' weeks .. this \n disappoints me..punishments..discharges..jackhammering..\" - Stephen Lawrence \n"

And enlightening.\n\nHere's my analysis of Jose Canseco, circa Sep '92, and Jose Canseco,\ncirca June 1986.\n\n1.  He's bulked up too much.  Period.  He needs to LOSE about 20 pounds,\n    not gain more bulk.\n\n2.  His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED.  Conservatively, I'd say he's\n    lost 4%-7% of his bat speed, and that's a HUGE amount of speed.\n\n3.  That open stance is KILLING him.   Note that he acts sort of like\n    Brian Downing - way open to start, then closes up as ball is\n    released.  Downing could do this without significant head movement -\n    Canseco can't.  Also, note that Canseco doesn't always close his\n    stance the same way - sometimes, his hips are open, sometimes,\n    they're fully closed.  Without a good starting point, it's hard\n    to make adjustments in your swing.\n\nWhat would I do, if I were Jose?\n\nAside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch,\nso that I'd never have to work again, I'd restructure my entire swing.\n\nFirst, minimize movement before the swing.  Close and widen the stance,\nand severely cut down the stride I take on my swing.  Hopefully, this\nwill cut down on the time I need to swing, and will allow me to move\nthe bathead more freely.\n\nSecond, drop 20 pounds.  Cut out the weight work.\n\nThird, relax the wrists.  Will cost some power, but until I can find\nmy 1988 stroke, concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up, rolling\nthe wrists through the strike zone, and hit line drives.  His strength\n is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of\nthe park.\n\nIf Canseco's open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back\nproblems, he'll be out of baseball in three years.  If not, he could\nstill hit 600+ HR.\n\n\n-- \n*   Gary Huckabay   * \"You think that's loud enough, a$$hole?\"           *\n*   \"Movie Rights   * \"Well, if you're having trouble hearing it, sir,   *\n*   available thru  *  I'd be happy to turn it up for you.

How do you know that the Sox are\nresponding to them, and not to Al Bumbry, Hobson, or (my most likely\nsuspect) new hitting coach Mike Easler? I certainly am more likely to give\nEasler credit for Mo Vaughhn's hot start than Clemens or Viola.\n\n>2. Greenwell is hitting as he did before his injuries.\nThis was the optimistic scenario, but not unreasonably so. He hasn't shown\nmuch power yet, though.\n\n>3.

Maybe Hobson is finally showing\nthose people skills he was supposed to have when they hired him. Or maybe\nit's all a myth. And Dawson has been hitting reasonably well, but not as\nwell as Greenwell, Vaughn, Cooper, or Fletcher.\n\n>4. Russell is finishing well.\nIn three games. Why don't we look at this one again in, say, July?\n\n>5. Fletcher is hitting well as a leadoff hitter.\nA bit better than could reasonably have been expected. But don't forget that\nZupcic looked like Wade Boggs lite for about 75 AB's last year. Beware of\nsmall sample sizes. Still, if Fletcher hits as well as he did last year he'd\nbe a great improvement over any Sox leadoff hitter from last year. Be aware\nthat his career numbers seem to indicate that he puts up good numbers as\nlong as he doesn't have to make more than 300 AB or so in a year.\n\n>6. Cooper is hitting well (I think he'll be better then Boggs in the field\n>and just as good at the plate)\nUmmm...sorry, no. I can buy the \"in the field\" part, and I think he'll be\nbetter at the plate than the 1992 Boggs, but in general Cooper, while he'll\nbe a pretty good hitter, couldn't carry Boggs' jockstrap. With a little\nluck, he could be the fourth or fifth best 3B in the AL (Martinez, Boggs,\nVentura, and Palmer will all be better).\n\n>If the sox Pitch like last year (they have a better pitchiong staff, now)\n>and hit like they are so far, they coiuld run away with thee division. but\n>since I think that their hitting and pitching may not be up to the challenge\n>of running away with the division, I think that they win be over .500 and at\n>least Third if not Second or First.\n\nSee, here is where you make that quick left turn off into the aether. .500\nis plausible, third is not unlikely, but phrases like \"could run away with\nthe division\" are likely to get you a visit from the men in the white\ncoats. It's not really clear that their staff is better than last year. If\nRussell does well, Darwin doesn't go on the DL, and Hesketh doesn't pitch\njust barely well enough to avoid losing his spot in the rotation, they could\nbe better. On the other hand, if Hesketh pitches miserably and they're too\nstupid to move him to the pen and bring up Conroy or somebody, Fossas\ncontinues to pitch dismally but they keep giving him innings becasue he's a\nlefty, and Russell explodes they could be pretty bad.\n\n Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com\n\nGod is a comedian playing to an audience that is afraid to laugh.\n\t- Mark Twain\n"

Perhaps, but I doubt it.  If you tell Joe Carter\nto go up there and take a few pitches, he will draw more walks, but\nhe also won't hit as many frozen ropes into the bleachers because\nhe is more likely to hold back on a pitch that he used to drive.\n\nThe \"Patient/Power\" guys?   Joe Morgan had a small strike zone and\nRickey Henderson has \"a strike zone the size of Hitler's heart\" \nso they get their walks based on the small zone.\n\nLook at the other 5 guys: Thomas, Bonds, McGwire, Ruth and Williams.  Wow!\nA lot of pitchers would rather nibble at the corners and maybe\nwalk these guys that to throw a clear strike to them.\nThe pitchers would do better (in my opinion) by just coming after\nthem with a good fastball for a strike on the first pitch, but pitchers\nwould rather nibble, go 2-0 or 3-1 and then get hurt.\n\nKen Kubey         kubey@wpd.sgi.com  (415) 390-3536\n"

As a result, I think I get more\nthan my fair share of borderline calls at the plate, because I have a\nrep of having a good eye.

For the past year or two, the AP has been getting box\nscores from STATS, Inc.  The AP representative in the press box is actually\na STATS reporter ($25 dollars a game, but free parking.  And anybody can\ndo it.)  The box is downloaded to STATS in Chicago, some quick error \nchecking is done, and then STATS sends it to the AP.  I'm not sure where\nthe appreveiations come in hear.

The Twins took two of three games in the series,\nwith scores as follows:\n\n                  Tuesday April 20th    MN  10\n                                        Mil  0\n                   Winning Pitcher Banks (2-0)  \n\n                  Wednesday April 21st  Mil 10  (10)\n                                        MN   8\n                    LP  - Hartley ( 0-1 )\n\n                  Thursday April 22nd   MN  5\n                                        Mil 4\n                    WP - Deshaies (4-0)\n                    Sa - Aguilera\n\nHighlight/Low Lights of the Series:\n------------------------------------\nJim Deshaies continues to be the surprise of not only the Twins, but of\nthe American League as well.  Going into today's game, Deshaies was 3-0\nwith a 1.74 ERA.  Deshaies allowed 2 Earned runs in 6 2/3 innings, meaning\nhis ERA will climb slightly.  Deshaies, who came to MN via a trade with\nPhiladelphia which sent David West there, continues to make Andy MacPhail\nlook like a true genius.\n\nWillie Banks has put together two solid starts for the Twins, going 6.1 innings\non Monday while coasting on solid Twins hitting.  Deshaies and Banks now \ncombine for 6 of the Twins eight victories, while Tapani/Mahomes/Erickson are\n0-5.\n\nWednesday's game marked the first opposing left-handed starting pitcher for the\nTwins this year (Rickey Bones).  The Twins teed off against both him and \nsubsequent relief, including a Grand Slam by Kent Hrbek which pushed the lead\nto 7-3.  The Twins pitching staff could not hold the lead, though, allowing\n4 walks in the 7th inning, 2 of which scored and coming with bases loaded.\nTapani gave up one walk before being relieved, Guthrie two walks, and Mike\nHartley one walk before the inning was over.  This tied the game at 7-7, and\nthe Brew Crew rocked Mike Hartley for 3 runs in the top of the tenth to win\nit.\n\nAguilera continues to be shaky against the Brew Crew.  6 of 20 career blown\nsaves have come against the Brew Crew, and today's game was shaky as well.\nComing into the ninth with a 5-2 lead, Aguilera gave up a solo HR to Vaughn,\nthen hits to Darryl Hamilton and Dickie Thon before finally retiring the\nside.  Once again, the tying run made it to second base on Aggie.\nWeak hearted Twins fans are advised not to watch Aggie in the ninth.\n\nGeneral News\n-------------------------------------\nPedro Munoz continues to improve as an outfielder, playing in left field on\nTuesday's game.  He continues to bat weakly against right handed pitching,\nthough, which has limited his playing time.  Gene Larkin and JT Bruett(former\nGopher) have been playing right field, as both can bat left handed.\n\nThe Twins begin a three game series with the Detroit Tigers tomorrow.  Starting\nPitching is tentatively scheduled as Erickson, Mahomes, Banks.  The Detroit\nTigers have had TWO 20 run games in the last ten days, and should provide \nquite a challenge to the young MN pitching staff.\n\nThe Twins have 9 HR's this year, three each from Puckett, Hrbek, and Winfield,\nthe third, fourth, and fifth batters, respectively.\n\nBrian Harper pegged 4 of the first 6 baserunners attempting to steal second\nthis year, and shows much improvement in this category.\n\nJim Deshaies has three pick-offs and one balk this year.  Some say he \nhas the best 1st base move in baseball.  This move has enabled him to pitch\nout of some tight early jams, and has certainly contributed to his 4-0 \nstart.  Watch to see if umpiring crews began calling the balk more tightly\nin response to opposing team complaints about his leg kicking behind the\nrubber on the pick-off move.\n\n\nCurrent MLB AL West Standings( from Joesph Hernandez, jtchern@ocb.berkeley.edu  )\n\nAMERICAN WEST         Won  Lost   Pct.

An\n>increase from 38 points to 53 points is not going to do that.  The arrival\n>of Mario Lemieux is what did it. \n\nYou can give the credit to Mario since he deserves it.  But my point is that\nit wasn't Mario himself, but it was the *expectation* of things to come (i.e.\na winning team) that he created by being the next great hockey superstar. And\nbefore anybody jumps in and says I'm nit-picking and mincing words, go back\nand read from where this thread started...\n\nIt might help to think about what would go through a fan's mind who suddenly\nfound an interest in Mario and the Pens.  Was it \"gee, Mario Lemieux is\namazing, I'll go watch him play\", or was it \"gee, now we've got a *kick*\n*ass* guy on *our* side, I'll go watch him play\".  I think it was the latter.\n\n> Similar thing happened in L.A.   Before\n>Gretzky's arrival, about 12000 per game.  After, constant sellouts.

They've had MUCH better teams in their past history than\n>they currently have, yet they didn't draw as well then.\n\nI don't think this is accurate.  The *tickets* sell, but people don't go to\nthe games.  I think this thread has already been discussed...season ticket\nholders in LA don't always use their tickets.  So in effect, after the Kings\ninitial success following Gretzky's arrival (68 to 91 points, same source)\nand corresponding attendance jump, there has been an effective drop in\nattendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much.  \n\nWhether or not the Kings are a 'winner' is debatable.  I claim that since\nGretzky's arrival they have at the very least been competitive...I also claim\nthat McNall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the Oiler\ndynasty...but that's another story and included only because I don't like\nMcNall:-).  Anyway,  McNall did do some heavy marketing around Gretzky, and\nthat undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising\nsales, etc.  But as I said, when the Kings have been in there little\ntailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at the\nForum even if the tickets were sold.\n\n>I think in the case of a Lemieux or Gretzky, the player can transcend\n>winning as the major drawing power.  \n\nFor the short term, IMO.  Although I think that it's inevitable that the team\nwill improve with a player such as Lemieux or Gretzky, simply because they\nmake people around them better.\n\n>But winning sure as hell helps.  ;-)\n\nWell, at least we are in full agreement here!\n\n>This does not make Roger's point any more valid, but the Jets aren't\n\nSo are you saying Roger has ever had a valid point? <couldn't resist...>\n\n>getting a HUGE jump in productivity, yet they ARE getting a huge\n>jump in attendance.  This is due to the emergence of Teemu Selanne.\n>They have the 17th best record in hockey, it sure as hell isn't because\n>they are winning.\n\nYes, but they are doing no worse than last year.  I think the same type of\nreasoning I applied to a new Pittsburgh fan applies to all the extra people\nshowing up at Winnipeg games.  It's difficult to predict, but do you think\nthat if the Jets miss the playoffs next season that in the year after they\nwill maintain their attendance levels?  I seriously doubt it, because in that\ncase the expectation of an improving team would be gone, with or without\nSelanne.\n\nI did provide the example of Rocket Ismail and the Toronto Argonauts of the \nCFL...did you leave it out because you don't know much about the CFL?  If \nthat's the case then fair enough, but if it isn't the case then I'm curious\nto hear your explanation.\n\n\n"

Have a care with Phil.  We liked him a lot in Pittsburgh.  He\ndidn't score a lot if you look at his stats last year but he worked his\nbutt off.  It was his speed that created opportunities in the offensive\nzone that allowed the Pens to utilize his potential.

Have a care with Phil.  We liked him a lot in Pittsburgh.  He\ndidn't score a lot if you look at his stats last year but he worked his\nbutt off.

In his two starts and\nhis relief effort for Beaupre, he has looked mighty sharp - don't\nforget the shutout.  I think he's let in just four goals over eight\nperiods of play.  I like Hrivnak, but we might actually have to give\nsome credit to David Poile for a change after this trade.\n\nHopefully if Tabaracci starts against the Isles tonight, I haven't\njinxed him.\n\nFrank Salvatore\nfmsalvat@eos.ncsu.edu\n"

After \nthe game, her coach, Gene Ubriaco, said Rheaume performed well enough to \ncompete for the No. 2 goalie spot with the Louisville IceHawks of the East \nCoast Hockey League next season. The Knights and the IceHawks are minor \nleague clubs of the Tampa Bay Lightning.\n**\n  As their first season comes to a close, there are rumors swirling that \nthe Tampa Bay Lightning just might become the Atlanta Lightning.  Or the \nMinnesota Lightning.  But they are just rumors, according to Lightning \ngeneral manager Phil Esposito.

Matchups will be based on overall points with the \nfour division champions being placed in the first- or second-place seeds \nin each conference and being assured of home-ice in the first two playoff \nrounds. All series will be best of seven (2-2-1-1-1 rotation) except \nmatchups between Central and Pacific teams.  Those series will rotate 2-3-\n2 to reduce travel.

A second phase then will be conducted where San Jose, Tampa \nBay and Ottawa will select two players each from the rosters of the two \nnew teams.\n        Ottawa, Tampa Bay and San Jose will be guaranteed priority \ndrafting selection in the 1993 draft as long as they have the three worst \nrecords. Anaheim and Miami will choose no lower than fourth and fifth. The \nexpansion franchises will move up in the draft should either San Jose, \nTampa Bay or Ottawa not finish in the bottom three positions.\n        The two new teams will pick first and second in the 1994 Entry \nDraft, regardless of their finish in 1993-94. Should either of the two new \nteams not play next season they would have priority drafting position in \n1994.\n\n        The owners announced the 1994 draft will be in Hartford and the \n1995 draft in Winnipeg. The 1994 draft was scheduled for Boston, but a \ndelay in the construction of a new arena required the draft be moved.\n\n-----\n \n- League news:\n\nDisputes:\n\n  The NHL owners and players have resolved differences over salary \narbitration procedures, clearing the way for about 40 hearings.

Franchise applications have \nbeen received from groups in Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, \nHouston, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Phoenix, San Francisco, Saskatoon, Toronto \nand Worcester, Mass., Boe said.\n        Although the league will not raid existing leagues to stock its \nrosters, Boe said it will seek the ``world's finest hockey players.''\n        Boe said league play will have an international flair and \ndiscussed implementing some rules which are reminiscent of those of the \nIIHF.\n        ``We're removing the red line, moving the goal nets forward and \neliminating all tie games,'' said Boe.\n        The MLH office will operate out of Stamford, Conn.\n\n-----\n \n- British Premier Division:\n \n contacts:\n  Neil A.

Answers to some frequently asked questions:\n \n Q: Why are the Montreal Canadiens called the Habs?\n A: Most of the team during the 40-50's was made up of people who lived in \nand around Montreal. Hence they were called \"Les Habitants\" (natives of \nMontreal). This was then shortened to the Habs.\n \n Q: Why is the Montreal Canadiens logo a large C with an H within it?\n A: In 1914-15, the Canadiens logo consisted of C with an A within it to \nsignify Club Athletique Canadien (CAC). The next year, CAC no longer \nexisted and it was changed to what it is now to signify Club de Hockey.\n\n Q: What is the most informative hockey publication?\n A: The Hockey News is preferred by most North American hockey fans. It is \na weekly journal with up-to-date info.\nPhone: 800-268-7793 (Canada and US)\nPhone/fax: 0483 776141 (UK and rest of Europe)\n \n Q: How does a 5-minute power-play count in the penalty killing stats in \nthe NHL?\n A: If X goals are scored, then the team gets credit for X goals in X+1 \nchances.\n \n Q: How is +/- computed in the NHL?\n A: First, +/- only applies to skaters. Except for a power-play goal, when \na goal is scored, each skater on the ice for the scoring team is given a \n+, and each skater on the ice for the other team is given a -. Short-\nhanded goals do count for +/-.\n \n Q: What is the five-hole?\n A: The space between a goalie's pads. There are five major scoring zones: \n(1) upper left corner of goal, (2) upper right, (3) lower left, (4) lower \nright, and (5) five-hole.\n \n Q: What is the meaning of throwing an octopus on the ice?\n A: This tradition began in Detroit in the 1950's when two best-of-seven \nseries were required to win the Stanley Cup. Every time Detroit won a \ngame, an octopus with one less arm was thrown on the ice.\n\n Q: Who was the first woman to play in an NHL game?\n A: Manon Rheaume, a 20-year-old goaltender, became the first woman ever \nto play in an NHL game on September 23, 1992 when she started in net for \nthe expansion Tampa Bay Lightning in an exhibition against the St. Louis \nBlues. Rheaume played the first period before 8,223 at the 10,400-seat \nExpo Hall on the Florida State Fairgrounds and allowed two goals on nine \nshots. She left with the score tied 2-2, although the Lightning ultimately \nlost the game, 6-4.\n\n Q: What is the richest contract in NHL history?\n A: Mario Lemieux, the superstar center of the Pittsburgh Penguins, signed \nthe richest contract in NHL history, a seven-year deal believed to be \nworth about $42 million. Lemieux will earn between $6 million and $7 \nmillion a year, nearly twice as much as any other player in the league.\n\n Q: Who is the new commissioner of the NHL?\n A: Gary Bettman, vice president and general counsel of the National \nBasketball Association, was named commissioner of the National Hockey \nLeague, Friday, December 11, 1992. Bettman joined the NBA in 1981 as \nassistant general counsel. He became the league's chief legal officer in \nSeptember of 1984. A New York resident, Bettman graduated from Cornell \nUniversity in 1974 and from New York University School of Law in 1977.\n\n Q: How many professional hockey leagues are there in North America?\n A: Six:  National, American, International, East Coast, Central and \nColonial Hockey Leagues.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n9.

These guys have absolutely no concept of how to play in front of the\ndamn net!!!  Watch them in the offensive zone, especially on the powerplay. \nDamphousse or Lebeau will skate all over the bloody zone, maybe pass to the\npoint, get it back, skate some more, pass it around....BUT WHERE'S THE SHOT??!\nAnswer: the shot is totally useless because they lack a forward who stands\nin front of the net a la` Neely, Shanahan, Tocchet, etc etc.  Too bad \nDemers won't put Dipietro or LeClair on the powerplay more often.  Dammit,\neven Ewen would at least cause some disruptions.  Montreal desperately needs\na power forward with some talent, IMO.\n\nThen watch them in their own zone. Patrick Roy is screened on everything. Say\nwhat you want about his performance; IMNSHO he cannot stop what he cannot see. \nAnd Montreal's defence does a miserable job of clearing the front of the net. \nLast night against Washington Roy played a *great* game.  The first goal came\non the most ridiculous goalmouth scramble I've seen in a long time, and he\ndidn't have a hope in hell of stopping the shot.  The second goal came on a\ndeflection of a shot he only partially saw anyway.  Pathetic defence.  The\nthird goal was EN.\n\nNo wonder he gets pissed off at his defencemen.\n\n\ndchhabra@stpl.ists.ca\n\n"

The ruling in\nCohen et al. v. Brown University is the first appeals court decision\nin the nation applying Title IX to intercollegiate athletics.  Trial\nLawyers for Public Justice (TLPJ), is the national public interest\nlaw firm representing the women athletes.\n   \"This ruling makes clear what we have said all along -- if a\nschool wants to eliminate teams before women have their fair share of\nopportunities to participate, they can only eliminiate men's teams,\"\nsaid TLPJ Executive Director Arthur Bryant, co-counsel in the case.\n   The class action, filed April, 1992, charged Brown with violating\nTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the federal law that\nprohibits sex discrimination by all educational institutions\nreceiving federal funds.  Brown terminated the two women's teams as\nuniversity-funded sports in May 1991, allowing them to continue to\ncompete against varsity teams if they could raise their own funds for\nuniforms, travel, coaches, and all other expenses.  They had also\nbeen denied admission preferences for use in recruiting new members.\n   \"This is a major victory for women and the cause of equal rights,\"\nsaid TLPJ lead counsel Lynette Labinger of Providence's Roney &\nLabinger.  \"Universities across America need to reevaluate their\nprograms quickly. Title IX is the law and it's going to be enforced.\"\n   Three similar Title IX appeals await decision.  Colorado State\nUniversity, Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP), and Colgate\nUniversity are asking federal appeals courts to overturn court orders\nrequiring them to reinstate or establish specific women's varsity\nteams.  Continuing its cutting-edge Title IX activities, TLPJ is\nrepresenting women athletes at IUP.\n   In addition to Labinger and Bryant, TLPJ's legal team included:\nRay Marcaccio of Blish & Cavanagh and Amato DeLuca of Mandell, DeLuca\n& Schwartz in Providence; and Sandra Duggan of Philadelphia.  The\nNational Women's Law Center, Women's Sports Foundation, and National\nAssociation for Girls and Women in Sports filed an amicus brief in\nsupport of TLPJ's appeal.\n -30-\n"

On-ice, the Leafs won the Atlantic Division title but\noff ice was less happy. A strike by public workers has forced the\nleafs out of the Newfoundland city for much of the last half of\nthe seaosn (since mid-Jan). They have played \"home\" games in places\nlike Montreal, Cornwall and Charlottetown. Their playoff \"home\"\ngames will be played in the Metro Center in Halifax, NS. One\ndemostration got violent. Workers attacked a Leafs' bus and\nrocked it and broke windows in the St John's Memorial Stadium.\nDespite the problems, Toronto officials insist that the Leafs\nwill return to St John's once the strike ends.\n===================================================\nSENATORS SOLD\nThe New Haven Senators have been sold by Peter Shipman to\nthe Ottawa Senators NHL organization. They are the only Canadian\nNHL team with an American AHL affiliate, and have made it clear\nthey intend to move the team to somewhere in the Canadian Atlantic\nProvinces. This sale and move has yet to be approved by the AHL\nhead office, but is expected to pass easily at the general meeting\nin May. The quote in the story from Jack Butterfield made it \nclear the league was more interested in the stability of the \nAHL franchise accompanied by NHL ownership, rather than maintaining\nthe 56-year history of the AHL in New Haven. \n\nThe Senators are currently in serious negotiations with Charlottetown\nNew Brunswick and are expected to move there.\n==================================================\nDALLAS HELPS HAWKS STAY IN MONCTON\nAfter announcing that they would pull their affiliation out\nof Moncton, the Winnipeg Jets changed their mind. \n\nThe Jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing\ntheir minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and they\nwanted to share with an existing AHL or IHL franchise.\n\nEnter the Dallas Lone Stars. Dallas agreed to supply the remaining\n6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise. Thus keeping the Hawks\nin the New Brunswick city.\n\nThe deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if\nthe season ticket base increases to over 3000. The Hawks only sold\n1400 for this year.\n============================================================\nSAINT JOHN FLAMES OFFICIAL\nThe Calgary Flames have officially signed a deal with the city of\nSaint John, NB. The Saint John Blue Flames will play in the 6200\nExhibition Center. The Flames still have to apply for an expansion\nfrnachise from the AHL but are expected to have no trouble.\n=========================================================\nCAPS FOLLOW JACKS TO MAINE\nDespite rumors to the contrary, the Capitals will follow the Baltimore\nSkipjacks to Maine. The Caps' current farm team, the Baltimore Skipjacks,\nannounced that they would move to Maine and become the Portland Pirates.\nThere was much doubt as to if the Caps would follow but they announced\na limited deal with Portland. They would supply a dozen or so players\nincluding 2 goalies. They become the third team to announce a limited\nfarm team along with Moncton and the Capital District Islanders.\n======================================================\nAHL GAME OF THE WEEK\nIn early January, the AHL started a game of the week. The game, produced\nby, I believe, Pyman Productions, was televised across the Canadian\nMaritimes and northeastern US. The first few weeks saw two games of\nthe week, one in Canada and another in the US but since then, there\nhas been only one. Sunday afternoon and night games were covered and\nshown on Sportschannel NY and NE in the US and, I believe, Atlantic\nSports Network in Canada (but I'm not sure about that). I am not\nsure if playoff games will be covered.\n=====================================================\nUTICA GONE? SYRACUSE ADDED?\nThere were heavy rumors that the Utica Devils will not be around next\nseason. There were rumors that they might be headed to a midwestern\ncity and that the city of Syracuse is trying to lure them.\n=====================================================\nWHAT THE AHL MIGHT LOOK LIKE NEXT YEAR\n\nONE OPTION\t\t\t\tANOTHER OPTION\n\t\t\t\nNorthern Division\t\t\tSouthern Division\nADIRONDACK RED WINGS\t\t\tADIRONDACK\nSPRINGFIELD INDIANS\t\t\tSPRINGFIELD\nPROVIDENCE BRUINS\t\t\tPROVIDENCE\nCD ISLANDERS\t\t\t\tCDI\nPORTLAND PIRATES\t\t\tHERSHEY\n\t\t\t\t\tBINGHAMTON\nSouthern Division\t\t\tROCHESTER\nHERSHEY BEARS\t\t\t\tHAMILTON\nBINGHAMTON RANGERS\t\t\tUTICA\nROCHESTER AMERICANS\nHAMILTON CANUCKS\t\t\tAtlantic Division\nUTICA (?)

If someone responds, I will repost it when I get it; otherwise, I will\nre-write it in a day or two and post it.  Sorry about that.\n\n#8\tLARRY DEPALMA\t\tSeason:\t3rd\nAcquired:\t'91-92, free agent from Minnesota\nGrade:\t\tI (C-/D+)\n\nNo netter/fan watching the Sharks, including me, knows where DePalma was at\nthe end of the season; the Sharks appeared to still have his rights, but he\nwasn't in San Jose, he wasn't in Kansas City, and his name hasn't appeared on\nthe waiver wire.  And that kind of invisibility was prevalent for the most part\nfor DePalma.  After being called up October 30 against the Tampa Bay Lightning,\nDePalma had an excellent week, scoring 5 points in 3 games while playing good\ndefense.  Unfortunately, the 27-year-old DePalma then disappeared the rest of\nthe way, getting just 3 more points in 15 more games, and generally looked\nlethargic and uninterested on both ends of the ice.  He then was sent down to\nKansas City, walked out from there, and was suspended and later reinstated\nwhen it was revealed that he was injured; he then promptly disappeared from\nthe watching eyes of Shark Bytes (as the mailing list is now known to Sharks\nofficials) faithful, and neither the Sharks nor we miss him.\n\n#10\tJOHAN GARPENLOV\t\tSeason: 3rd\nAcquired:\t'91-92, trade with Detroit for D Bob McGill and 8th round\n\t\tpick in '92 entry draft from Vancouver\nGrade:\t\tA/A-\n\nAfter an early slump, Garpenlov was nothing short of inspirational the rest\nof the way, finishing with 66 points in 79 games, second highest total on the\nteam, as he clicked well with team MVP Kelly Kisio and right wing Rob\nGaudreau.  Kisio got most of the credit, but Garpenlov, finishing second in\nthe MVP voting, clearly demonstrated his playmaking and scoring skills, as he\nwas seen making excellent centering passes as well as finishing passes to him\nby putting the puck past opposing goaltenders, getting a club-high 14 power-\nplay goals.  Contrary to his previous rep, Garpenlov also showed that despite\nhis small size (5' 11\", 183 lbs.), he was willing to throw himself around\nwhen necessary, albeit not very successful yet.  He also still needs to work\non his defense, although he improved tremendously throughout the season, and\nwas actually quite a good penalty killer by the end of the season.  He will\nbe a major key to the offense next year.\n\n#15\tDAVID BRUCE\t\tSeason: 5th\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from St. Louis in expansion draft\nGrade:\t\tI (?)\n\nAfter a banner '91-92, when he led the team in power-play goals (10) and\nwas third in total scoring (38 points in 60 games), Bruce was bothered\nvirtually all of this season with a groin injury, which kept him out of the\nlineup for all by 17 games this season.  Of course, it is difficult to\nspeculate how well he would have done this season had he not been affected by\nthe injury, but the 28-year-old Bruce was effective with a man up or a man\nshort in the Sharks' first season, and was expected to be a strong offensive\nleader this season as well.  The injury appears serious, which is a shame,\nbecause otherwise he may have a much brighter future for now; instead, his\nfuture with the Sharks next season appears clouded.\n\n#18\tMARK PEDERSON\t\tSeason:\t3rd\nAcquired:\t'92-93, trade with Philadelphia for C/LW Dave Snuggerud\nGrade:\t\tI (B)\n\nIt is difficult for me to understand the Flyers' decision to unload Pederson,\nafter a very good offensive season last season (40 points in 58 games), but\nafter riding the pine early in the season, Pederson was summarily sent to the\nSharks in exchange of the defensive-minded Snuggerud, and he finished with\n41 games combined with the Flyers and the Sharks.  He was also limited by\ninjuries this season, and this limited his production (17 points).  But when\nhealthy, Pederson appears impressive, with a good scoring touch, good size\n(and the willingness to throw it around, although he's not considered a\nphysical forward), and good speed.  He also does not appear to be a liability\non defense, but the Sharks probably have to wait until next season to see how\nmuch, exactly, Pederson can do.\n\n#20\tJOHN CARTER\t\tSeason: 4th\nAcquired:\t'91-92, free agent from Boston\nGrade:\t\tI (B+/B)\n\nCarter was definitely one of the hardest workers on the team, and the hard\nwork worked wonders, as at times he looked great on ice.  However, although he\ndid look great at times, the fact that he received just 16 points (in 55\ngames) for his efforts is a sign that there is only so much his hard work can\ndo, and the Sharks confirmed that by sending him to Kansas City with about\n20 games left in the season.  Carter, who will turn 30 on May 6, always\nhussled, but as a result, was sometimes trapped too deep within the offensive\nzone while forechecking, but he was generally a credit on the defensive end,\nbut he is probably of limited utility in that capacity, and he did not impress\noffensively, although he was one of the best Sharks at drawing penalties.  He\nis very unlikely to be back next season.\n\n#28\tJEAN-FRANCOIS QUINTIN\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tI (B+/B)\n\nI don't understand why the Sharks didn't let Quintin play any more than the\n14 games he played this season.  He was generally hard-working and creating\nopportunities offensively, and appeared, at age 23, ready for regular NHL\nduty, at least for a team like the Sharks, finishing with 7 points in those\n14 games while not being a defensive liability.  Shoulder injury in training\ncamp before the '91-92 season limited Quintin, the team's leading scorer in\nexhibition games despite sitting out the final two, to just 29 games with the\nSharks and the Blades that season, but he looked impressive.  He should be a\nsolid contender for regular duty next season.\n\n#41\tMARK BEAUFAIT\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t2nd round pick in 1991 supplemental draft\nGrade:\t\tI (?)\n\nAfter a all-star season at Kansas City, Beaufait got a cup of coffey with the\nSharks late in the season when the Blades knocked down a playoff spot and the\nSharks decimated with injuries, playing 5 games and scoring a goal for his only\nNHL point thus far.  Despite small size (5' 9\", 165 lbs.), Beaufait was not shy\nto throw himself around when necessary, and looked pretty good at times,\nalthough it's too early to judge him based on 5 NHL games, in which he played\nmostly left wing, away from his center position at Northern Michigan and\nKansas City.\n\n#42\tJAROSLAV OTEVREL\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t8th round pick in 1991 entry draft\nGrade:\t\tI (?)\n\nLike Beaufait, Otevrel also played away from his normal position when he was\nup for his cup of tea (7 games) midway through the season.  He was generally\nvery much of a defensive liability, and did not show much offensively either,\nalthough that may be more indicative of the lack of ice time he got in those\n7 games.  He may need another season to work on his defense, but once his\ndefense is acceptable, he should be ready.\n\n#44\tMICHEL PICARD\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t'92-93, trade with Hartford for LW Yvon Corriveau\nGrade:\t\tI (B-/C+)\n\nThe 23-year-old Picard, although he perennially tore up the minors, seems to\nbe close to being out of chances, for some reason, after being acquired by the\nSharks but failing to impress the management in 25 games, scoring 4 goals for\nhis only points, and he spent most of the rest of the way in Kansas City.\nHe was not particularly strong defensively, and despite his offensive\nbrilliance in the minors, he has failed thus far to score in the NHL, although\nhe has been given limited opportunities.  He may be the Sharks' bait in the\nexpansion draft.\n\n#45\tDODY WOOD\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t3rd round pick in 1991 entry draft\nGrade:\t\tI (D+/D, although perhaps I shouldn't give a grade at all)\n\nI have been accused of knocking on Wood too much. :-)  Then, it is probably\nno surprise to you that I am thoroughly unimpressed by Wood thus far, although\n13 games is a small example.  He was generally a nonfactor on offense, was\nnot particularly good defensively, and took too many silly penalties, losing\nmany fights in the process and gathering 69 penalty minutes in those 13 games,\nprojecting to to 446(!) in an 84-game season.  He's not ready, and needs at\nleast another season at KC, where he can work on his fighting skills, if\nnothing else.  His relatively small size (5' 11\", 181 lbs.) does not give much\npossibility that he can survive, at this stage, as an enforcer.\n\n===============================================================================\nGO CALGARY FLAMES!

(My\nroommate just about sh*t when they threw the octopus on the ice. (Thanks\nfor explaining the significance of that BTW)) The only problem I had was\nwhen they blotted out the local commentators with the baseball ads and\nmusic. Especially when the wings player hit the rut and went into the\nboards injuring his shoulder and they blotted out the injury report. Other\nthen that, hats off to ESPN.

If you check the THN stats for\nKansas City, you'll find that Larry has been playing for the games, having\nplayed in 8 games in the period covered in the stats between 3/26 and the\n4/16 issue (1-3-4 with 13 PIM). Not exactly invisible.\n\n>He then was sent down to\n>Kansas City, walked out from there, and was suspended and later reinstated\n>when it was revealed that he was injured; he then promptly disappeared from\n>the watching eyes of Shark Bytes (as the mailing list is now known to Sharks\n>officials) faithful, and neither the Sharks nor we miss him.\n\nWell, having gotten to a chance to talk to him a few times, this isn't quite\naccurate. He injured his back (a disk injury) and did one stupid thing,\nwhich was to hide it from the Sharks and he tried to play through it because\nhe knew he was on the bubble. The Sharks then sent him to K.C., at which\npoint he disclosed the injury. Since he didn't disclose it, the Sharks and\nhe disagreed about the responsibility and he was suspended for not\nreporting. That was eventually worked out, the Sharks re-instated him as\ninjured and put him into therapy, and when he was able to play then shipped\nhim down to K.C. He fully expects to play in the NHL again, although clearly\nnot with the Sharks (hiding injuries is a stupid no-no, beyond just a\nno-no).\n\nVery nice guy. Always hustled his butt off. He disappeared because he was\nhurt. I expect he'll surface with another team at some point (probably\nanother expansion team), but is likely to be a bubble player for the rest of\nhis career. Has a good work ethic and is good at getting other players\nmotivated. Unfortunately, he played himself out of the Sharks future with a\nbad judgement call.\n\n\n>#20\tJOHN CARTER\t\tSeason: 4th\n>Acquired:\t'91-92, free agent from Boston\n>Grade:\t\tI (B+/B)\n\n> He\n>is very unlikely to be back next season.\n\nAlways gave 110%, best work ethic on the club (except maybe Kisio), but\nhustle isn't always enough. His future with the Sharks was made clear to me\none night against the Flames when he went behind the crease and tried to\nhold Joel Otto against the board. He literally had one arm around Otto's\nneck and another wrapped around Otto's stick arm. Otto casually turned\naround and fed the puck in front of the crease for a goal, as though Carter\nwasn't there. Hustle can only cover size so far.\n\nThe Sharks have told me, point blank, that he's gone for good (ditto HUbie\nMcDonough). He was one of the favorites of the staff, but as one said to me\n\"you have to make room for the kids\". Carter, in fact, refused to report to\nK.C. and has been suspended by the Sharks. That might be a defacto\nretirement, but I haven't heard anything official. His only hope in hockey\nnow is the Gulls.\n\n>#28\tJEAN-FRANCOIS QUINTIN\tSeason: 1st\n>Acquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\n>Grade:\t\tI (B+/B)\n\n>I don't understand why the Sharks didn't let Quintin play any more than the\n>14 games he played this season.\n\nBecause, at least from the games I saw him in, he was outmatched and looked\nfairly lost on the ice. I think he shows potential, but I didn't think he\nwas quite ready to make the jump to the NHL.\n\n> He should be a solid contender for regular duty next season.\n\nAgreed (BTW, I still think a lot of your grades are more based on how you\nwish they'd performed than how they actually performed. I wonder whether you\ncan really judge talent from radio and television, Nelson? I know I have\ntrouble, since you don't see the off-puck action. your views from home and\nmy views from the ice differ in numerous ways)\n\n>#41\tMARK BEAUFAIT\t\tSeason: 1st\n>Acquired:\t2nd round pick in 1991 supplemental draft\n>Grade:\t\tI (?)\n\n>After a all-star season at Kansas City, Beaufait got a cup of coffey with the\n\nCoffee.

While they had been considered a possible contender when Jacques\nDemers first arrived, in his last two years they were, respectively,\nembarrassed in the first round by Chicago, and then failed to make the \nplayoffs (at a time, a might add, when there were only five teams in the\nNorris).\n\nIt's true that Vancouver did not make the playoffs for many a year before \nQuinn came, but in those years the Smythe Division was a lot--I mean *a lot*--\ntougher division than the Norris, also known as the \"Snorris\", division.\nVancouver had to play Edmonton and Calgary, both very legitimate Stanley\nCup contenders, eight times a year, while Detroit got to play such \npowerhouses as Toronto and Minnesota.  Now, Edmonton is hardly even a force\nin the league, and the Smythe even has the mighty San Jose sharks, while\nover this same period of time in which Vancouver was improving, so was \neverybody in the Norris (except St. Louis).  Detroit had to improve just\nto keep up with the competition in their division.  They had to improve *a\nlot* to get better than their competition in the Norris.\n\nBryan Murray inherited a team with very little talent.  For really good\nplayers, they had Yzerman, Burr, and Probert, and that was about it.  (And\nno doubt some will dispute whether Burr and Probert were that good). The\nrest were either very green rookies or washed up veterans.  The only reason\nthey got as far as they did in the years before Murray came was due to the\ncoaching of Demers, who, at least at first, got every last ounce of effort\npossible out of his team.  Then, even his coaching began to degrade.\n\n>So Quinn has improved his team more than Murray has since taking over as a GM.\n>Quinn is one example of a better GM than Murray.\n\nThere are a number of reasons why Detroit wasn't in as bad a shape standings\nwise when Murray took over as Vanc. was when Quinn took over, some of which\nI outlined above, but Murray did not have any better personnel to work with\nat the outset than did Quinn, with the exception of Yzerman.  And one player\ncannot alone make a team into a Stanley Cup contender, as I'm sure everyone\nreading this will agree.  \n\nWe'll be able to see better which team is really the most improved when they\nface each other in the conference final (assuming they don't get knocked out,\nlike last year).\n\n>Gregmeister\n\n--Randy\n\n"

Game winner in OT in game 1, and another\nBIG goal (seconds after Fuhr made 3 point blank saves -> this is why\nGrant has 5 rings!!!) to put Buffalo ahead in the 3rd.  Yes, Neely countered\na minute later, but hadn't this course of Buffalo going ahead after being\ntied and shutting down another few great scoring opportunities, I\nthink Boston would have notched their first win of the series.\n\nWell, the Sabres haven't made it to the end of this series yet, but\nI certainly feel they've got Boston right were they want them...actually,\nthey've got them in a position that neither Buffalo nor Boston felt\nthat would come about.  One more astronomical game by Fuhr, a few more\nheroics by the rest of the team (this is a team sport afterall) and I\nthink Borque, Neely, Jouneau (sp?), and Company are gonna be swinging\na new stick (Weather is perfect for golf season) real soon.  I'm not\ngonna waiger anything on this, because I've seen some really strange\nthings happen in both pro and college hockey.\n\nTalking about golf...was that a hockey swing, golf swing or baseball\nswing that Hawerchuck used in the last shot of the game that Khmylev\ndeflected in for the BIG ONE?  The whole OT (all 1 minute of it!) was a\ntesiment to Buffalo's ability to really be persistent and grind it out\nin the end (something they weren't necessarily in the regular season).  The\nSabres pushed hard and forced Borque to blatently take down Bodger in\nthe opening seconds.  I don't normally like penalties being called in\nsuch ultra-critical points, but this was BLATENT.  Finally, the Sabres\nwon a faceoff (they weren't that hot in this dept the rest of the game)\nwhen LaFontaine scooped at the puck 3 times.  When Hawerchuck took his\nshot (quite a boomer, but Blue stopped this one) he took a few steps\nover to get his own rebound and slapped at it again, without setting\nit up.  I didn't realize it went in until the announcer started screaming,\n\"They score, THEY SCORE!!!\".  The best was seeing LaFontaine jumping\nup and down, skating a little bit, jumping some more, and then skating\nover to Brad May who he jumped on.\n\nDoug McKee\nmckee@cs.buffalo.edu\n"

People were\ncheering the Blues long before face-off time, and they kept going for the\nentire game. My friends and I went out celebrating until the early morning\nhours with some of the players. Here's a game summary from the St. Louis\nPost-Disptach. Enjoy...\n\nBy Dave Luecking\nOf The Post-Dispatch Staff:\n\nAt 10:24 p.m. Friday night, The Arena crowd of 17,965 paid homage to Blues\ngoalie Curtis Joseph. The fans began bowing, their arms extended, taking the\nthe lead from a fan who held a sign that read ``Only God Saves More Than\nJoseph.\"  It was a fitting tribute to Joseph, who has brought the Blues to\nthe verge of a surprising sweep.\n\nJoseph recorded his second successive shutout Friday, blanking the Blackhawks\n3-0 in Game 3 of the Norris Division semifinals and giving the Blues a 3-0\nlead in the best-of-seven series.\n\nThe Blackhawks haven't scored against Joseph since the 8:51 mark of the second\nperiod of Game 1. Joseph has shut out the Blackhawks for 151 minutes 9 seconds,\na Blues record. Jacques Plante held the previous record of 146:28, set in the\nfirst round of the 1969 playoffs against the Philadelphia Flyers, one of only\ntwo series the Blues have sweeped in their history.\n\nThe Blues can wrap up their first sweep since 1969 with a victory in Game 4,\na nationally televised game that begins at noon Sunday. The Blues have had\nonly two sweeps in franchise history, both in 1969, when they swept\nPhiladelphia and Los Angeles en route to the Stanley Cup finals.\n\nThe shutout Friday was easier than on Wednesday in Game 2 when Joseph had to\nmake 47 saves. This time, the Blues held the shots down to 34, and the\nBlackhawks couldn't touch Joseph.\n\nWell, they touched Joseph, numerous times, shoving him and pushing him at \nevery opportunity to try to get him off his game. But Joseph and the Blues\nwere unfazed, dishing out their own punishment along the way.\n\nThe Blues' grinders -- Bob Bassen, Rich Sutter, Kevin Miller and Dave Lowry --\nwore down the Blackhawks, taking the visitors from Chicago off their game.\nThe grinders set the stage for the glamour boys, the gifted playmakers and\nscorers, who made the most of their opportunities.\n\nCraig Janney, Brett Hull and Nelson Emerson scored, getting one goal in each\nperiod. Hull assisted on Janney's first-period power play goal after two unwise\nChicago penalties. Checker Miller set up Hull's goal in the second period, and\nrookie Denny Felsner assisted for Emerson, who scored at 16:44 of the final \nperiod.\n\nBlues fans jumped to their feet in celebration of that goal and began yelling\n``Sweep. Sweep. Sweep.\" They also taunted Chicago goalie Ed Belfour \n``Bell-Four. Bell-Four.\" They also chanted ``Na, na-na-na, hey-hey good bye.\"\n\nSuch talk is a tad premature. There's still one game left, but the Blues are\non a roll. They have the Blackhawks on their heels.\n\nThe Blues set the tone early on Friday with two crunching hits in the first\nminute of play. Rich Sutter leveled Bryan Marchment, and Brendan Shanahan\ndumped Steve Smith at center ice.\n\nChicago tried to retaliate, but Troy Murray's decision to run into Joseph\nbackfired. Referee Dan Marouelli gave him a roughing penalty.\n\nThe Blues didn't get a shot on goal on the power play, and they survived a\nscare after Chicago killed the penalty when Rick Zombo gave the puck away to\nSteve Larmer. Joseph stopped Larmer's shot and everything else Chicago threw\nat him in the first period. The 'Hawks ignored the scouting report on Joseph\nabout shooting high and continued to shoot low, where Joseph's butterfly\nstyle is deadly.\n\nRookie Bret Hedican picked up three consecutive penalties midway through the\nperiod -- two for hooking and one for holding -- but Chicago got only two\nshots on goal, as many as Miller. The Blues' penalty killer twice stole the\npuck and just missed on good scoring chances against Belfour.\n \nMarouelli began calling penalties on the Blackhawks to even things up.\nHe caught Brent Sutter hooking Shanahan four seconds after Hedican's third\npenalty. He called Marchment for elbowing Janney along the boards at 14:58,\nand gave the Blues a two-man advantage 1:07 later when Christian Ruuttu\nslashed Shanahan.\n\nThe Blues worked around the puck on the ensuing power play, and Hull got it\nwhere he likes it -- in the high slot. Hull's shot hit Belfour's right\nshoulder, and the puck bounced precariously close to the goal line. Belfour\ndived back to cover, but the puck squirted loose to Janney, who poked it into\nthe net at 16:53 for his first goal of the playoffs.\n\nThe Blues continued their relentless hitting as the period ended, and the\nBlackhawks lost their composure. Joe Murphy tripped Ron Wilson with two seconds\nremaining in the period, and after time had expired Smith upset the Blues by\nshooting the puck into the Blues' bench.\n\nChris Chelios made a move toward Joseph as the teams left the ice, and\nMarouelli slapped him with a 10-minute misconduct. Chicago survived the Blues'\npower play, but the loss of Chelios hurt. He didn't return until the midway\npoint of the period, and within three minutes of his return, Hull had increased\nthe Blues' lead to 2-0, deflecting in Miller's crisp pass.\n\nTry as they might, the Blackhawks couldn't get to Joseph, who stopped\neverything they could throw at him.

The Swedes continued to make mistakes as Howald\n was allowed to skate in between the Swedish D and put the puck past Tommy\n to make it 0-2. 0-3 was a nice one, Howald entered the Swedish zone, slammed\n on the breaks, and his shot went in by Tommy's far post. One of the lousiest\n periods I've seen Sweden play this year.\n Second period saw a new Swedish team, and the Swiss had to ice the puck many\n times. On a pp, Nylander skated in from the boards, Pavoni made the initial\n save, but Peter Andersson scored on the rebound.  Then a power play goal\n from the Swiss, a slap shot from the blue line hit two players on the way\n to the goal and past Soderstrom also. Jonas Bergqvist made it 2-4 after a\n nice pass from Naslund behind the goal. Jan Larsson reduced the lead to 3-4\n just before the end of 2nd period, on a pp skated in unattacked in front of\n the goal, and put the puck through Pavoni's 5-hole. \n Third period, Sweden equalized on a slap shot from Renberg that trickled\n through Pavoni's 5-hole. Then, another defensive mistake by the Swedes,\n Waeger was allowed to skate around the Swedish goal unattacked and from close\n range could make it 4-5. Hollenstein then scored 4-6 on a 2-on-1 break away,\n and put it top shelf with no chance for Soderstrom.\n\n Switzerland:\n\n Goaltender:  20 Reto Pavoni  (28 Renatio Tosio)\n Defense:     26 Rick Tschumi, 2 Martin Steinegger\n              16 Sven Leuenberger, 5 Martin Rauch\n               7 Sandro Bertaggia, 17 Patrick Sutter\n              31 Samuel Balmer\n Forwards:    22 Alfred Luthi, 11 Felix Hollenstein, 25 Roman Waeger\n              23 Gil Montandon, 12 Roberto Triulzi, 10 Patrick Howald\n              35 Christian Weber, 18 Andreas Ton, 24 Joerg Eberle\n              15 Bruno Erni, 13 Thomas Vrabec, 29 Manuele Celio\n \n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n RUSSIA - CANADA  1-3 (0-2,1-1,0-0)\n\n 1st: CAN 0-1 Kevin Dineen 1     (Garry Galley)                       4:28\n      CAN 0-2 Paul Kariya 2      (Eric Lindros)                      12:20 (pp)\n 2nd: CAN 0-3 Eric Lindros 10    (Paul Kariya,Shayne Corson)          9:40\n      RUS 1-3 Valeri Karpov 2    (?)                                 16:24\n 3rd:\n\n Penalties: RUS 2*2min 1*5min, CAN 5*2min\n Referee: Anton Danko, Czech republic\n Attendance: 8,600\n\n Russia probably made their best game of the tourney, but yet there wasn't\n enough to win against the effective Canadians.\n\n Galley took a slap shot that found Dineen by the far post, and Dineen just\n deflected the puck past Trefilov in the Russian goal. Then a power play\n goal, after a couple of deflections Eric Lindros found Kariya alone by the\n far post, and Kariya put the puck high over a sliding Trefilov.\n Russia won the shots in the first period 12-5, and they had the most of\n the scoring opportunities, but they just couldn't score.\n Second period saw Lindros scoring his 10th (!!) goal of the WC. Kariya\n entered the Russian zone, slammed on the break to get past his defenseman,\n then made a nice pass to Corson who just got the stick on the puck to\n deflect it to Lindros who one-timed the puck.\n The Russians then finally got their goal, Karpov broke in from the side\n and made a slap shot in Tugnutt's top right hand corner.\n \n Player of the game in Canada was voted Paul Kariya, and for Russia Valeri\n Karpov. I agree, the difference in this game was Lindros and Kariya, and\n in part also Tugnutt. Kariya had a far better game now than vs the Swedes,\n and he was very impressive. Kariya got the place in the line with Lindros\n after Mike Gartner went out with a rib-injury early in the first period.\n\n Lindros, BTW, lead the point scoring with 14 pts (9+5) before this game,\n 7 pts ahead of the next player! i.e. double as much as the next player\n (among those Kariya with 1+6).

He's ineffective in Calgary, but he might be able to help\na team like San Jose, with their shortage of talent.

It\n(this FAQ, not RIPEM) was written and will be maintained by Marc\nVanHeyningen, <mvanheyn@whale.cs.indiana.edu>.  It will be posted to a\nvariety of newsgroups on a monthly basis; follow-up discussion specific\nto RIPEM is redirected to the group alt.security.ripem.\n\nThis month, I have reformatted this posting in an attempt to comply\nwith the standards for HyperText FAQ formatting to allow easy\nmanipulation of this document over the World Wide Web.  Let me know\nwhat you think.\n\nDISCLAIMER\n----------\nNothing in this FAQ should be considered legal advice, or anything\nother than one person's opinion.  If you want real legal advice, talk\nto a real lawyer.\n\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\n---------------------\n\n1)  What is RIPEM?\n\n RIPEM is a program which performs Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) using\n the cryptographic techniques of RSA and DES.  It allows your\n electronic mail to have the properties of authentication (i.e. who\n sent it can be confirmed) and privacy (i.e. nobody can read it except\n the intended recipient.)\n\n RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>.\n Most of the code is in the public domain, except for the RSA routines,\n which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.\n\n2)  How can I get RIPEM?\n\n RIPEM contains the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF, which is\n considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution\n to people who are not citizens or permanent residents of the U.S. or\n Canada.  Therefore, the following request is quoted from the README\n file:\n\n #Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution\n #outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me,\n #the author of RIPEM, and a condition of your use of RIPEM.\n\n Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain, and a license for it is\n included with the distribution.  You should read it before using\n RIPEM.\n\n The best way to get it is to ask a friend for a copy, since this will\n reduce the load on those sites that do carry it (not to mention the\n humans that run them.)  Naturally this requires that you trust the\n friend.\n\n RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent residents\n in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the README file for\n info.  Last I looked, this site contains only the source tree, and\n does not contain compiled binaries or the nice Mac version.\n\n RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its \"home site\" on\n rpub.cl.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the\n U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out\n how to obtain access, ftp there, cd to pub/crypt/, and read the file\n GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience, binaries for many architectures are\n available here in addition to the full source tree.\n\n3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine?\n\n Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of\n Unix (SunOS, NeXT, Linux, AIX, ULTRIX, Solaris, etc.)  Ports to\n Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice\n Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau, author of StuffIt.  More ports\n are expected, and help of users is invited.\n\n4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer?\n\n Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend\n on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though.  The users\n guide, included with the distribution, discusses ways to use RIPEM\n with many popular mailers, including Berkeley, mush, Elm, and MH.\n Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU\n Emacs.\n\n If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one\n in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use, secure,\n and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem.\n\n5)  What is RSA?\n\n RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key.  This means\n that there are two different, related keys: one to encrypt and one to\n decrypt.  Because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other,\n you may publish your encryption, or public key widely and keep your\n decryption, or private key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public\n key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to\n decrypt it.  (Note that the \"message\" sent with RSA is normally just\n the DES key to the real message. (See \"What is DES?\")\n\n Note that the above only provides for privacy.  For authentication,\n the fingerprint of the message (See \"What is a fingerprint, like\n MD5?\") is encrypted with the sender's private key.  The recipient can\n use the sender's public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message\n must have come from the sender.\n\n RSA was named for the three men (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) who\n invented it.  To find out more about RSA, ftp to rsa.com and look in\n pub/faq/ or look in sci.crypt.\n\n6)  What is DES?\n\n DES is the Data Encryption Standard, a widely used symmetric, or\n secret-key, crypto system.  Unlike RSA, DES uses the same key to\n encrypt and decrypt messages.  However, DES is much faster than RSA.\n\n RIPEM uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts\n your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the\n recipient's public RSA key and includes the result in the letter,\n allowing the recipient to recover the DES key.\n\n DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a\n key length considered too short by modern standards.  However, it\n should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large\n corporation or government agency.  It is not unlikely that future\n RIPEMs will strengthen the symmetric cipher, possibly by using\n multiple encryption with DES.\n\n7)  What is PEM, and how does RIPEM relate?\n\n PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail, a system for allowing easy transfer of\n encrypted electronic mail.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; these\n documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115.\n\n RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM, because PEM\n specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which RIPEM does not\n handle at this time.  Their addition is planned.\n\n8)  What's this about distributing and authenticating keys?\n\n For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know\n your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message\n received came from her, you must know her public key.  It is important\n that this information be accurate; if a \"bad guy\" convinces her that\n his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read.\n\n RIPEM allows for three methods of key management: a central server,\n the distributed finger servers, and a flat file.  All three are\n described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution.\n None of them provide perfect security.\n\n9)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar?\n\n RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS identifier describing various\n characteristics about the key, so the first bunch of characters in\n your key may be the same as those of lots of other people's keys.\n This does not mean your keys are similar, but only that they are the\n same class of key, were generated with the same program, are of the\n same length, etc.\n\n10)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5?\n\n MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc.\n It provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash,\n of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not\n possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a\n different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus,\n instead of signing the entire message with the sender's private key,\n only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication.\n\n MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often\n used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a\n passphrase interpreter or cookie generator.\n\n MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in\n RFC 1321.\n\n11)  What is PGP?\n\n PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy.\n PGP has been around longer than RIPEM, and works somewhat differently.\n PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way, though PGP does also use RSA.\n\n Some major differences between PGP and RIPEM:\n\n - PGP has more key management features, particularly for users without\n   a direct network connection.\n\n - RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability of\n   working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be compatible\n   with anything other than PGP (in fact, PGP 1.0 is not compatible with\n   PGP 2.0.)\n\n - RIPEM uses RSAREF, a library of RSA routines from RSA Data Security\n   Inc.  RSAREF comes with a license which allows noncommercial use.\n   PGP uses its own implementation of RSA which is not licensed; thus,\n   PKP, the firm holding the U.S. patents on the RSA algorithm, claims\n   that it is a infringement of that patent to make, use or sell PGP in\n   the U.S. or Canada.  In acknowledgement of this, PGP's original\n   author, Phil Zimmermann, says in the documentation:\n\n   #In fact, if you live in the USA, and you are not a Federal agency, \n   #you shouldn't actually run PGP on your computer, because Public\n   #Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software.  PGP is\n   #contraband.  \n\n - Both PGP and RIPEM are export-restricted, and cannot be sent outside\n   the U.S. and Canada.  However, PGP already exists on many ftp sites\n   in Europe and other places.\n\n Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever, the documentation to PGP is\n recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues.\n\n Note that the above facts, both regarding patent and export\n restrictions, are somewhat controversial; many people think it\n shouldn't be that way, and some people interpret various documents\n differently.  Unfortunately, discussions of it on the net inevitably\n seem to produce more heat than light, and probably belong in\n misc.legal.computing.  (See:  \"DISCLAIMER\")\n\n12)  What about RPEM?\n\n RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail.  It was similar to RIPEM,\n but used a public-key cipher invented by Rabin (which is not RSA) in\n an attempt to avoid the patent on RSA.  It was written by Mark\n Riordan, the same author as RIPEM.\n\n Its distribution was halted when, contrary to the beliefs of many\n (including Rabin), Public Key Partners (PKP) claimed that their patent\n was broad enough to cover any public-key cipher whose strength rested\n in the difficulty of factoring products of large primes, not just RSA.\n This claim is not universally accepted by any means, but was not\n challenged for pragmatic reasons.\n\n RPEM is not really used anymore.  It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP.\n\n13)  What is MIME?\n\n MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, and is\n described in RFC 1341.  You can find out about it in the newsgroup\n comp.mail.mime.  How PEM should interact with MIME is not yet entirely\n clear; some people use the stopgap solution of having a MIME type\n application/x-ripem in order to send RIPEM messages as MIME ones.  I\n hope some standards will emerge.  Draft Internet documents exist on\n the matter.\n\n14)  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM...\n\n You may wish to check the companion post \"ripem-attacks\" which\n discusses some of the more obvious attacks on RIPEM's security and\n what procedures will minimize the risk.  RIPEM's main \"weak area\" is\n probably key distribution.\n"

It gives police the power to put\ninnocent people in jail because they (the police) find something they don't\nunderstand.  Most police don't know what the return key does, never mind the\ndifference between a core file and classified military secrets.\n\nThere are plenty of scenarios where the user would have no idea what something\nis either.  It could be uninitialized junk.  The burden of proof is on the\nuser to show that it's something a normal upstanding citizen should have.  No\none should ever be put in that situation, especially in America.\n\nWhat's disgusting about this is how easily most people go along with it, to\nprovide a bargaining chip against some hypothetical *alleged* child molester\nor drug dealer, or whatever bad thing is in style at the time.  Basically most\npeople don't have a clear distinction between criminals and suspects.\n\nAs an analogy, it's like they find a loose screw in your house, and they\ninsist that you're building a bomb or machine gun.  They ask you where it came\nfrom (like you'd know), and ask you to prove your claim.  When you explain it\nin such simple terms, people may start to get the idea.\n\nAs a matter of fact, i do keep random files on my disk.  The reason is,\nwithout special-purpose hardware, it takes a long time to generate good random\nbits.  I have programs that crank out a couple bits per minute, which is\npretty conservative, but over time that's more than i need.\n\nIf you think about it, there's no point in actually encrypting random data,\nbecause it just gives you different random data.  If you want some data to\nlook like an encrypted file, you just put an appropriate header on it.  If\nenough people do this, some of them will be put in jail.\n\nWhen you get arrested and the police ask for your keys, you can tell them it's\njust random junk, although of course they won't believe you.  While you're\nsitting in jail, you can take consolation in the fact that the government will\nburn a few CPU-years trying to find something that's not there.\n\n--\nJoe Keane, amateur cryptologist\njgk@osc.com (uunet!amdcad!osc!jgk)\n"

Rather than use technology to accommodate\nthe sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and\nlaw enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against\nindustry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.\n\nSophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to\nprotect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to\nprotect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption\ntechnology can help Americans protect business secrets and the\nunauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used\nby terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.\n\nA state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \"Clipper Chip\" has\nbeen developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a\nnew approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,\nrelatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to\nan ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications\nusing an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in\ncommercial use today.\n\nThis new technology will help companies protect proprietary\ninformation, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations\nand prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted\nelectronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the\nability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to\nintercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. \n\nA \"key-escrow\" system will be established to ensure that the\n\"Clipper Chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding\nAmericans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique\n\n\n                                2\n\n\n\"keys,\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government\nagencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the\ndevice is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately\nin two \"key-escrow\" data bases that will be established by the\nAttorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to\ngovernment officials with legal authorization to conduct a\nwiretap.\n\nThe \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with no\nnew authorities to access the content of the private\nconversations of Americans.\n\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the\nAttorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new\ndevices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the\ngovernment will be offered access to the confidential details of\nthe algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report\ntheir findings.\n\nThe chip is an important step in addressing the problem of\nencryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the\nprivacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield\ncriminals and terrorists.  We need the \"Clipper Chip\" and other\napproaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access\nto the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it\nto hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology\ntrends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),\nthe President has directed government agencies to develop a\ncomprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:\n\n     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to\n          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;\n\n     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone\n          calls and data, under proper court or other legal\n          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;\n\n     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern\n          technology to build the National Information\n          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and\n          the competitiveness of American industry in the global\n          marketplace; and \n\n     --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export\n          high technology products.\n\nThe President has directed early and frequent consultations with\naffected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the\nprivacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.\n\n\n\n                                3\n\nThe Administration is committed to working with the private\nsector to spur the development of a National Information\nInfrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer\ntechnologies to give Americans unprecedented access to\ninformation.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks\n(\"information superhighways\") will transmit video, images, HDTV\nprogramming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone\nsystem transmits voice.\n\nSince encryption technology will play an increasingly important\nrole in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act\nquickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding\nits use.  The Administration is committed to policies that\nprotect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting\nthem from those who break the law.\n\nFurther information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. \nThe provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new\nencryption technology are also available.  \n\nFor additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of\nStandards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.\n\n---------------------------------\n\n\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S\nTELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE\n\n\n\n\nQ:   Does this approach expand the authority of government\n     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?\n\nA:   No.  \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with\n     no new authorities to access the content of the private\n     conversations of Americans.\n\nQ:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\n     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation\n     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to\n     decipher the message?\n\nA:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\n     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They\n     would then present documentation of this authorization to\n     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and\n     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug\n     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are\n     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key\n     escrow system.\n\nQ:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?\n\nA:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent\n     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the\n     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will\n     oversee the key-escrow data banks.\n\nQ:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure\n     how strong the security is?  \n\nA:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption\n     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will\n     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow\n     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of\n     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all\n     potential users that there are no unrecognized\n     vulnerabilities.\n\nQ:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?\n\nA:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the\n     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in\n     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the\n     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet\n     officials.\n\nQ:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?\n\nA:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on\n     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify\n     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have\n     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the\n     decisions related to this initiative.\n\nQ:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?\n\nA:   The government designed and developed the key access\n     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the\n     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product\n     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip\n     manufacturer that produces them.\n\nQ:   Who provides the \"Clipper Chip\"?\n\nA:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,\n     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device\n     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed\n     to other vendors in the future.\n\nQ:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? \n\nA:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating\n     the \"Clipper Chip\" into their devices.\n     \nQ:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological\n     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be\n     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more\n     powerful encryption devices?\n\nA:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be\n     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow\n     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product\n     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive\n     than others readily available today, but it is just one\n     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to\n     encryption technology, which the Administration is\n     developing.\n\n     The Administration is not saying, \"since encryption\n     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,\n     we will prohibit it outright\" (as some countries have\n     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \"every\n     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an\n     unbreakable commercial encryption product.\"  There is a\n     false \"tension\" created in the assessment that this issue is\n     an \"either-or\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,\n     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,\n     balanced approach such as is proposed with the \"Clipper\n     Chip\" and similar encryption techniques.\n\nQ:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton\n     Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from\n     that of the Bush Administration?  \n\nA:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption\n     technology in telecommunications and computing and are\n     committed to working with industry and public-interest\n     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'\n     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law\n     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime\n     and terrorism.\n\nQ:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use\n     the government hardware?\n\nA:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control\n     requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is\n     required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The\n     same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the\n     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give\n     to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this\n     in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a\n     case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these\n     devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan\n     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability\n     of these products.\n\n \n     \n"

We need the \"Clipper Chip\" and other\napproaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access\nto the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it\nto hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology\ntrends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),\nthe President has directed government agencies to develop a\ncomprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:\n\n     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to\n          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;\n\n     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone\n          calls and data, under proper court or other legal\n          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;\n\n     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern\n          technology to build the National Information\n          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and\n          the competitiveness of American industry in the global\n          marketplace; and \n\n     --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export\n          high technology products.\n\nThe President has directed early and frequent consultations with\naffected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the\nprivacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.\n\n\n\n                                3\n\nThe Administration is committed to working with the private\nsector to spur the development of a National Information\nInfrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer\ntechnologies to give Americans unprecedented access to\ninformation.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks\n(\"information superhighways\") will transmit video, images, HDTV\nprogramming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone\nsystem transmits voice.\n\nSince encryption technology will play an increasingly important\nrole in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act\nquickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding\nits use.  The Administration is committed to policies that\nprotect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting\nthem from those who break the law.\n\nFurther information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. \nThe provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new\nencryption technology are also available.  \n\nFor additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of\nStandards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.\n\n- - ---------------------------------\n\n\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S\nTELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE\n\n\n\n\nQ:   Does this approach expand the authority of government\n     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?\n\nA:   No.  \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with\n     no new authorities to access the content of the private\n     conversations of Americans.\n\nQ:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\n     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation\n     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to\n     decipher the message?\n\nA:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\n     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They\n     would then present documentation of this authorization to\n     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and\n     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug\n     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are\n     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key\n     escrow system.\n\nQ:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?\n\nA:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent\n     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the\n     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will\n     oversee the key-escrow data banks.\n\nQ:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure\n     how strong the security is?  \n\nA:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption\n     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will\n     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow\n     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of\n     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all\n     potential users that there are no unrecognized\n     vulnerabilities.\n\nQ:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?\n\nA:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the\n     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in\n     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the\n     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet\n     officials.\n\nQ:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?\n\nA:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on\n     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify\n     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have\n     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the\n     decisions related to this initiative.\n\nQ:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?\n\nA:   The government designed and developed the key access\n     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the\n     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product\n     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip\n     manufacturer that produces them.\n\nQ:   Who provides the \"Clipper Chip\"?\n\nA:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,\n     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device\n     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed\n     to other vendors in the future.\n\nQ:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? \n\nA:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating\n     the \"Clipper Chip\" into their devices.\n     \nQ:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological\n     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be\n     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more\n     powerful encryption devices?\n\nA:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be\n     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow\n     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product\n     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive\n     than others readily available today, but it is just one\n     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to\n     encryption technology, which the Administration is\n     developing.\n\n     The Administration is not saying, \"since encryption\n     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,\n     we will prohibit it outright\" (as some countries have\n     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \"every\n     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an\n     unbreakable commercial encryption product.\"  There is a\n     false \"tension\" created in the assessment that this issue is\n     an \"either-or\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,\n     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,\n     balanced approach such as is proposed with the \"Clipper\n     Chip\" and similar encryption techniques.\n\nQ:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton\n     Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from\n     that of the Bush Administration?  \n\nA:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption\n     technology in telecommunications and computing and are\n     committed to working with industry and public-interest\n     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'\n     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law\n     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime\n     and terrorism.\n\nQ:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use\n     the government hardware?\n\nA:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control\n     requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is\n     required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The\n     same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the\n     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give\n     to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this\n     in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a\n     case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these\n     devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan\n     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability\n     of these products.\n"

[PGP, RIPEM, PEM, ...]\n* Is the UNIX crypt command secure?\n* How do I use compression with encryption?\n* Is there an unbreakable cipher?\n* What does ``random'' mean in cryptography?\n* What is the unicity point (a.k.a. unicity distance)?\n* What is key management and why is it important?\n* Can I use pseudo-random or chaotic numbers as a key stream?\n* What is the correct frequency list for English letters?\n* What is the Enigma?\n* How do I shuffle cards?\n* Can I foil S/W pirates by encrypting my CD-ROM?\n* Can you do automatic cryptanalysis of simple ciphers?\n* What is the coding system used by VCR+?\n\n\n* How do I recover from lost passwords in WordPerfect?\n\n  WordPerfect encryption has been shown to be very easy to break.\n  The method uses XOR with two repeating key streams: a typed password\n  and a byte-wide counter initialized to 1+<the password length>. Full\n  descriptions are given in Bennett [BEN87] and Bergen and Caelli\n  [BER91].\n\n  Chris Galas writes: ``Someone awhile back was looking for a way to\n  decrypt WordPerfect document files and I think I have a solution. \n  There is a software company named: Accessdata (87 East 600 South,\n  Orem, UT 84058), 1-800-658-5199 that has a software package that will\n  decrypt any WordPerfect, Lotus 1-2-3, Quatro-Pro, MS Excel and Paradox\n  files. The cost of the package is $185. Steep prices, but if you\n  think your pw key is less than 10 characters, (or 10 char) give them a\n  call and ask for the free demo disk. The demo disk will decrypt files\n  that have a 10 char or less pw key.''\n\n* How do I break a Vigenere (repeated-key) cipher?\n\n  A repeated-key cipher, where the ciphertext is something like the\n  plaintext xor KEYKEYKEYKEY (and so on), is called a Vigenere cipher.\n  If the key is not too long and the plaintext is in English, do the\n  following: \n\n  1. Discover the length of the key by counting coincidences.\n  (See Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].) Trying each displacement of\n  the ciphertext against itself, count those bytes which are equal. \n  If the two ciphertext portions have used the same key, something\n  over 6% of the bytes will be equal. If they have used different\n  key, then less than 0.4% will be equal (assuming random 8-bit bytes\n  of key covering normal ASCII text). The smallest displacement which\n  indicates an equal key is the length of the repeated key.\n\n  2. Shift the text by that length and XOR it with itself. This\n  removes the key and leaves you with text XORed with itself. Since\n  English has about 1 bit of real information per byte, 2 streams of\n  text XORed together has 2 bits of info per 8-bit byte, providing\n  plenty of redundancy for choosing a unique decryption. (And in fact\n  one stream of text XORed with itself has just 1 bit per byte.)\n\n  If the key is short, it might be even easier to treat this as a\n  standard polyalphabetic substitution. All the old cryptanalysis\n  texts show how to break those. It's possible with those methods, in\n  the hands of an expert, if there's only ten times as much text as key.\n  See, for example, Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].\n\n* How do I send encrypted mail under UNIX? [PGP, RIPEM, PEM, ...]\n\n  Here's one popular method, using the des command:\n\n    cat file | compress | des private_key | uuencode | mail\n\n  Meanwhile, there is a de jure Internet standard in the works called\n  PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail). It is described in RFCs 1421 through\n  1424. To join the PEM mailing list, contact pem-dev-request@tis.com.\n  There is a beta version of PEM being tested at the time of this\n  writing.\n\n  There are also two programs available in the public domain for encrypting\n  mail: PGP and RIPEM.  Both are available by FTP.  Each has its own\n  newsgroup: alt.security.pgp and alt.security.ripem.  Each has its own FAQ\n  as well.\n\n  PGP is most commonly used outside the USA since it uses the RSA algorithm\n  without a license and RSA's patent is valid only (or at least primarily)\n  in the USA.\n\n  RIPEM is most commonly used inside the USA since it uses the RSAREF which\n  is freely available within the USA but not available for shipment outside\n  the USA.\n\n  Since both programs use a secret key algorithm for encrypting the body of\n  the message (PGP used IDEA; RIPEM uses DES) and RSA for encrypting the\n  message key, they should be able to interoperate freely.  Although there\n  have been repeated calls for each to understand the other's formats and\n  algorithm choices, no interoperation is available at this time (as far as\n  we know).\n\n* Is the UNIX crypt command secure?\n\n  No. See [REE84]. There is a program available called cbw (crypt\n  breaker's workbench) which can be used to do ciphertext-only attacks\n  on files encrypted with crypt. One source for CBW is [FTPCB].\n\n* How do I use compression with encryption?\n\n  A number of people have proposed doing perfect compression followed by\n  some simple encryption method (e.g., XOR with a repeated key).\n\n  Unfortunately, you can only compress perfectly if you know the exact\n  distribution of possible inputs. For all practical purposes it's\n  impossible to describe ``the typical English text'' beyond coarse\n  characteristics such as single-letter frequencies. You can build up\n  more and more sophisticated models of your inputs, but if the enemy\n  has a slightly more accurate model, he'll be able to find some\n  redundancy in your compressed output.\n\n  Note that nearly all practical compression schemes, unless they\n  have been designed with cryptography in mind, produce output that\n  actually starts off with high redundancy. For example, the output of\n  UNIX compress begins with a well-known three-byte ``magic number''\n  that can serve as an entering wedge for cryptanalysis.\n  \n  This is not to say that compression before encryption is inherently a\n  bad idea; it just has to be done very, very carefully, and by no means\n  removes the need for strong encryption.\n\n  Compression after encryption is silly.\n\n* Is there an unbreakable cipher?\n\n  Yes. The one-time pad is unbreakable; see part 4. Unfortunately the\n  one-time pad requires secure distribution of as much key material as\n  plaintext.\n\n  Of course, a cryptosystem need not be utterly unbreakable to be\n  useful. Rather, it needs to be strong enough to resist attacks by\n  likely enemies for whatever length of time the data it protects is\n  expected to remain valid.\n\n* What does ``random'' mean in cryptography?\n\n  Cryptographic applications demand much more out of a pseudorandom\n  number generator than most applications. For a source of bits to be\n  cryptographically random, it must be computationally impossible to\n  predict what the Nth random bit will be given complete knowledge of\n  the algorithm or hardware generating the stream and the sequence of\n  0th through N-1st bits, for all N up to the lifetime of the source.\n\n  A software generator (also known as pseudo-random) has the function\n  of expanding a truly random seed to a longer string of apparently\n  random bits.  This seed must be large enough not to be guessed by\n  the opponent.  Ideally, it should also be truly random (perhaps\n  generated by a hardware random number source).\n\n  Those who have Sparcstation 1 workstations could, for example,\n  generate random numbers using the audio input device as a source of\n  entropy, by not connecting anything to it.  For example,\n\n\tcat /dev/audio | compress - >foo\n\n  gives a file of high entropy (not random but with much randomness in\n  it).  One can then encrypt that file using part of itself as a key,\n  for example, to convert that seed entropy into a pseudo-random\n  string.\n\n  When looking for hardware devices to provide this entropy, it is\n  important really to measure the entropy rather than just assume that\n  because it looks complicated to a human, it must be \"random\".  For\n  example, disk operation completion times sound like they might be\n  unpredictable (to many people) but a spinning disk is much like a\n  clock and its output completion times are relatively low in entropy.\n\n* What is the unicity point (a.k.a. unicity distance)?\n\n  See [SHA49]. The unicity distance is an approximation to that amount\n  of ciphertext such that the sum of the real information (entropy) in\n  the corresponding source text and encryption key equals the number\n  of ciphertext bits used. Ciphertexts significantly longer than this\n  can be shown probably to have a unique decipherment. This is used to\n  back up a claim of the validity of a ciphertext-only cryptanalysis. \n  Ciphertexts significantly shorter than this are likely to have\n  multiple, equally valid decryptions and therefore to gain security\n  from the opponent's difficulty choosing the correct one.\n\n  Unicity distance, like all statistical or information-theoretic\n  measures, does not make deterministic predictions but rather gives\n  probabilistic results: namely, the minimum amount of ciphertext\n  for which it is likely that there is only a single intelligible\n  plaintext corresponding to the ciphertext, when all possible keys\n  are tried for the decryption. Working cryptologists don't normally\n  deal with unicity distance as such. Instead they directly determine\n  the likelihood of events of interest.\n\n  Let the unicity distance of a cipher be D characters. If fewer than\n  D ciphertext characters have been intercepted, then there is not\n  enough information to distinguish the real key from a set of\n  possible keys. DES has a unicity distance of 17.5 characters,\n  which is less than 3 ciphertext blocks (each block corresponds to\n  8 ASCII characters). This may seem alarmingly low at first, but\n  the unicity distance gives no indication of the computational work\n  required to find the key after approximately D characters have been\n  intercepted.\n\n  In fact, actual cryptanalysis seldom proceeds along the lines used\n  in discussing unicity distance. (Like other measures such as key\n  size, unicity distance is something that guarantees insecurity if\n  it's too small, but doesn't guarantee security if it's high.) Few\n  practical cryptosystems are absolutely impervious to analysis; all\n  manner of characteristics might serve as entering ``wedges'' to crack\n  some cipher messages. However, similar information-theoretic\n  considerations are occasionally useful, for example, to determine a\n  recommended key change interval for a particular cryptosystem.\n  Cryptanalysts also employ a variety of statistical and\n  information-theoretic tests to help guide the analysis in the most\n  promising directions.\n\n  Unfortunately, most literature on the application of information\n  statistics to cryptanalysis remains classified, even the seminal\n  1940 work of Alan Turing (see [KOZ84]). For some insight into the\n  possibilities, see [KUL68] and [GOO83].\n\n* What is key management and why is it important?\n\n  One of the fundamental axioms of cryptography is that the enemy is in\n  full possession of the details of the general cryptographic system,\n  and lacks only the specific key data employed in the encryption. (Of\n  course, one would assume that the CIA does not make a habit of telling\n  Mossad about its cryptosystems, but Mossad probably finds out anyway.)\n  Repeated use of a finite amount of key provides redundancy that can\n  eventually facilitate cryptanalytic progress. Thus, especially in\n  modern communication systems where vast amounts of information are\n  transferred, both parties must have not only a sound cryptosystem but\n  also enough key material to cover the traffic.\n\n  Key management refers to the distribution, authentication, and\n  handling of keys.\n\n  A publicly accessible example of modern key management technology\n  is the STU III secure telephone unit, which for classified use\n  employs individual coded ``Crypto Ignition Keys'' and a central Key\n  Management Center operated by NSA. There is a hierarchy in that\n  certain CIKs are used by authorized cryptographic control\n  personnel to validate the issuance of individual traffic keys and\n  to perform installation/maintenance functions, such as the\n  reporting of lost CIKs.\n\n  This should give an inkling of the extent of the key management\n  problem. For public-key systems, there are several related issues,\n  many having to do with ``whom do you trust?''\n\n* Can I use pseudo-random or chaotic numbers as a key stream?\n\n  Chaotic equations and fractals produce an apparent randomness from\n  relatively compact generators. Perhaps the simplest example is a\n  linear congruential sequence, one of the most popular types of random\n  number generators, where there is no obvious dependence between seeds\n  and outputs. Unfortunately the graph of any such sequence will, in a\n  high enough dimension, show up as a regular lattice. Mathematically\n  this lattice corresponds to structure which is notoriously easy for\n  cryptanalysts to exploit. More complicated generators have more\n  complicated structure, which is why they make interesting pictures---\n  but a cryptographically strong sequence will have no computable\n  structure at all.\n\n  See [KNU81], exercise 3.5-7; [REE77]; and [BOY89].\n\n* What is the correct frequency list for English letters?\n\n  There are three answers to this question, each slightly deeper than\n  the one before. You can find the first answer in various books:\n  namely, a frequency list computed directly from a certain sample of\n  English text. Of course any such list will be ``correctly'' computed,\n  but exactly which list you get depends on which sample was taken.\n\n  The second answer is that the question doesn't make sense. What do\n  you mean by ``English letters''? The ``English language'' is not a\n  fixed, finite, closed object that can be exactly characterized. It\n  has changed over time; it is different between different authors.\n  Any particular message will have different statistics from those of\n  the language as a whole.\n\n  The third answer is that yes, no particular message is going to have\n  exactly the same characteristics as English in general, but for all\n  reasonable statistical uses these slight discrepancies won't matter.\n  In fact there's an entire field called ``Bayesian statistics'' (other\n  buzzwords are ``maximum entropy methods'' and ``maximum likelihood\n  estimation'') which studies questions like ``What's the chance that a\n  text with these letter frequencies is in English?'' and comes up with\n  reasonably robust answers.\n\n  So make your own list from your own samples of English text. It will\n  be good enough for practical work, if you use it properly.\n\n* What is the Enigma?\n\n  ``For a project in data security we are looking for sources of\n  information about the German Enigma code and how it was broken by\n  the British during WWII.''\n\n  See [WEL82], [DEA85], [KOZ84], [HOD83], [KAH91].\n\n* How do I shuffle cards?\n\n  Card shuffling is a special case of the permutation of an array of\n  values, using a random or pseudo-random function.  All possible output\n  permutations of this process should be equally likely.  To do this, you\n  need a random function (modran(x)) which will produce a uniformly\n  distributed random integer in the interval [0..x-1].  Given that\n  function, you can shuffle with the following [C] code: (assuming ARRLTH\n  is the length of array arr[] and swap() interchanges values at the two\n  addresses given)\n\n  for ( n = ARRLTH-1; n > 0 ; n-- ) swap( &arr[modran( n+1 )], &arr[n] ) ;\n\n  modran(x) can not be achieved exactly with a simple (ranno() % x) since\n  ranno()'s interval may not be divisible by x, although in most cases the\n  error will be very small.  To cover this case, one can take ranno()'s\n  modulus mod x, call that number y, and if ranno() returns a value less\n  than y, go back and get another ranno() value.\n\n\n* Can I foil S/W pirates by encrypting my CD-ROM?\n\n  Someone will frequently express the desire to publish a CD-ROM with\n  possibly multiple pieces of software, perhaps with each encrypted\n  separately, and will want to use different keys for each user (perhaps\n  even good for only a limited period of time) in order to avoid piracy.\n\n  As far as we know, this is impossible, since there is nothing in standard\n  PC or workstation hardware which uniquely identifies the user at the\n  keyboard.  If there were such an identification, then the CD-ROM could be\n  encrypted with a key based in part on the one sold to the user and in\n  part on the unique identifier.  However, in this case the CD-ROM is one\n  of a kind and that defeats the intended purpose.\n\n  If the CD-ROM is to be encrypted once and then mass produced, there must\n  be a key (or set of keys) for that encryption produced at some stage in\n  the process.  That key is useable with any copy of the CD-ROM's data.\n  The pirate needs only to isolate that key and sell it along with the\n  illegal copy.\n\n\n* Can you do automatic cryptanalysis of simple ciphers?\n\n  schneier@chinet.chi.il.us (Bruce Schneier) says: AccessData of Orem,\n  Utah sells products that break the password scheme of a number of\n  popular Macintosh and PC software packages.

The parts are\nmostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest.\nWe don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask.\nNotes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.\n\nThe sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu \nas /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography \nFAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers \nevery 21 days.\n\n\nContents:\n\n* What is the National Security Agency (NSA)?\n* What are the US export regulations?\n* What is TEMPEST?\n* What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax?\n* What is the American Cryptogram Association, and how do I get in touch?\n* Is RSA patented?\n* What about the Voynich manuscript?\n\n\n* What is the National Security Agency (NSA)?\n\n  The NSA is the official security body of the U.S. government. It\n  was given its charter by President Truman in the late 40's, and\n  has continued research in cryptology till the present. The NSA is\n  known to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the world,\n  and is also the largest purchaser of computer hardware in the\n  world. Governments in general have always been prime employers of\n  cryptologists. The NSA probably possesses cryptographic expertise many\n  years ahead of the public state of the art, and can undoubtedly break\n  many of the systems used in practice; but for reasons of national\n  security almost all information about the NSA is classified.\n\n  Bamford's book [BAMFD] gives a history of the people and operations of\n  the NSA. The following quote from Massey [MAS88] highlights the\n  difference between public and private research in cryptography:\n\n  ``... if one regards cryptology as the prerogative of government,\n  one accepts that most cryptologic research will be conducted\n  behind closed doors. Without doubt, the number of workers engaged\n  today in such secret research in cryptology far exceeds that of\n  those engaged in open research in cryptology. For only about 10\n  years has there in fact been widespread open research in\n  cryptology. There have been, and will continue to be, conflicts\n  between these two research communities. Open research is common\n  quest for knowledge that depends for its vitality on the open\n  exchange of ideas via conference presentations and publications in\n  scholarly journals. But can a government agency, charged with\n  responsibilities of breaking the ciphers of other nations,\n  countenance the publication of a cipher that it cannot break? Can\n  a researcher in good conscience publish such a cipher that might\n  undermine the effectiveness of his own government's code-breakers?\n  One might argue that publication of a provably-secure cipher would\n  force all governments to behave like Stimson's `gentlemen', but one\n  must be aware that open research in cryptography is fraught with\n  political and ethical considerations of a severity than in most\n  scientific fields. The wonder is not that some conflicts have\n  occurred between government agencies and open researchers in\n  cryptology, but rather that these conflicts (at least those of which\n  we are aware) have been so few and so mild.''\n\n* What are the US export regulations?\n\n  In a nutshell, there are two government agencies which control\n  export of encryption software. One is the Bureau of Export\n  Administration (BXA) in the Department of Commerce, authorized by\n  the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). Another is the Office\n  of Defense Trade Controls (DTC) in the State Department, authorized\n  by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). As a rule\n  of thumb, BXA (which works with COCOM) has less stringent\n  requirements, but DTC (which takes orders from NSA) wants to see\n  everything first and can refuse to transfer jurisdiction to BXA.\n\n  The newsgroup misc.legal.computing carries many interesting\n  discussions on the laws surrounding cryptographic export, what\n  people think about those laws, and many other complex issues which\n  go beyond the scope of technical groups like sci.crypt. Make sure to\n  consult your lawyer before doing anything which will get you thrown in\n  jail; if you are lucky, your lawyer might know a lawyer who has at\n  least heard of the ITAR.\n\n* What is TEMPEST?\n\n  TEMPEST is a standard for electromagnetic shielding for computer\n  equipment. It was created in response to the discovery that\n  information can be read from computer radiation (e.g., from a CRT) at\n  quite a distance and with little effort.\n\n  Needless to say, encryption doesn't do much good if the cleartext\n  is available this way.\n\n* What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax?\n\n  (Thanks to Jim Gillogly for this information and John King for\n  corrections.)\n\n  The story in a pamphlet by J. B. Ward (1885) goes: Thomas\n  Jefferson Beale and a party of adventurers accumulated a huge mass\n  of treasure and buried it in Bedford County, Virginia, leaving\n  three ciphers with an innkeeper; the ciphers describe the\n  location, contents, and intended beneficiaries of the treasure.\n  Ward gives a decryption of the second cipher (contents) called B2;\n  it was encrypted as a book cipher using the initial letters of the\n  Declaration of Independence (DOI) as key. B1 and B3 are unsolved;\n  many documents have been tried as the key to B1.\n\n  Aficionados can join a group that attempts to solve B1 by various\n  means with an eye toward splitting the treasure:\n\n  The Beale Cypher Association\n  P.O. Box 975\n  Beaver Falls, PA 15010\n\n  You can get the ciphers from the rec.puzzles FAQL by including the\n  line:\n\n  send index\n\n  in a message to netlib@peregrine.com and following the directions.\n  (There are apparently several different versions of the cipher\n  floating around. The correct version is based on the 1885 pamphlet,\n  says John King <kingj@hpcc01.corp.hp.com>.)\n\n  Some believe the story is a hoax. Kruh [KRU88] gives a long list of\n  problems with the story. Gillogly [GIL80] decrypted B1 with the DOI\n  and found some unexpected strings, including ABFDEFGHIIJKLMMNOHPP.\n  Hammer (president of the Beale Cypher Association) agrees that this\n  string couldn't appear by chance, but feels there must be an\n  explanation; Gwyn (sci.crypt expert) is unimpressed with this\n  string.\n\n* What is the American Cryptogram Association, and how do I get in touch?\n\n  The ACA is an organization devoted to cryptography, with an emphasis\n  on cryptanalysis of systems that can be attacked either with\n  pencil-and-paper or computers. Its organ ``The Cryptogram'' includes\n  articles and challenge ciphers. Among the more than 50 cipher types in\n  English and other languages are simple substitution, Playfair,\n  Vigenere, bifid, Bazeries, grille, homophonic, and cryptarithm.\n\n  Dues are $15 for one year (6 issues); more outside of North America;\n  less for students under 18 and seniors. Subscriptions should be sent\n  to ACA Treasurer, 18789 West Hickory St., Mundelein, IL 60060.\n\n* Is RSA patented?\n\n  Yes. The patent number is 4,405,829, filed 12/14/77, granted 9/20/83.\n  For further discussion of this patent, whether it should have been\n  granted, algorithm patents in general, and related legal and moral\n  issues, see comp.patents and misc.legal.computing. For information\n  about the League for Programming Freedom see [FTPPF]. Note that one of\n  the original purposes of comp.patents was to collect questions such as\n  ``should RSA be patented?'', which often flooded sci.crypt and other\n  technical newsgroups, into a more appropriate forum.\n\n* What about the Voynich manuscript?\n\n  nelson@reed.edu (Nelson Minar) says there is a mailing list on the\n  subject.  the address to write to subscribe to the VMS mailing list\n  is: <voynich-request@rand.org>\n\n  the ftp archive is: rand.org:/pub/voynich\n\n  There's all sorts of information about the manuscript itself, of\n  course. A good bibliography can be found on the ftp site. Kahn's\n  \"The Codebreakers\" gives a good introduction.\n"

(was Re: text of White House announcement and Q&As on clipper chip encryption)\n\nThis announcement is somewhat disconcerting; it doesn't do anything\nevil in and of itself, but bodes badly for the future of open\nalgorithms and standards in information security.  I won't start\npanicking until/unless DES or RSA or stuff like that is prohibited, but\nI'm a little anxious.  (No doubt it won't be long before someone posts\nexplaining how this just a small part of some far-ranging and\nlong-lived NSA-PKP-IRS-FBI-CIA-HandgunControlInc-Clinton conspiracy to\nsubvert freedom, democracy, and mathematics.)  My feeling is that the\nadministration probably isn't that worried about things like DES and\nRSA and PGP and RIPEM, since they'll never be used by a group much\nwider than us computer geeks.\n\nThe fact that this just came out now suggests one of two things:\n\n1.  The NSA has been working on this for a long time, and it only just\n    now happened to be ``ready'' to release to the world at this time.\n\n2.  The NSA has been working on this for a long time, but wasn't able\n    to get the Bush administration to go along with this plan.  (I\n    find it unlikely that this would have been because of a sympathy\n    for the unescrowed use of cryptography; more likely the\n    administration felt that even escrowed, secret-algorithm and, for\n    all we know, trivially breakable cryptography should not be made\n    widely available.)\n\nThus said clipper@csrc.ncsl.nist.gov (Clipper Chip Announcement):\n>This new technology will help companies protect proprietary\n>information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations\n>and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted\n>electronically.

Does anyone\nknow if that means this chip is designed to work primarily with analog\nsignals?  The language sort of suggests this, but it's hard to say.\n\nThe main thing I just don't get is whether this chip implements\nsymmetric or asymmetric cryptographic techniques.  Anybody know?\n\nI'm guessing symmetric, but they don't get very clear about it.  If it\nis symmetric, how is it useful for anything other than link-level\nencryption with an identical chip at each end?  How can you negotiate\na per-session key using symmetric cryptography without using a trusted\nthird party who knows your key?  (Or does it even use a per-session\nkey?)\n\nIf it's asymmetric, what about PKP's patents, which they claim cover\nall methods of doing asymmetric cryptography?  Are they getting\nroyalties, or is hiding infringement the real reason for keeping the\nalgorithm secret? :-)\n--\nMarc VanHeyningen   mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu   MIME & RIPEM accepted\nKirk:  I won't hurt you.\nAlien: You hit me!\nKirk:  Well, I won't hit you again.\n"

I, for one,\n: would *gladly* pay royalties via purchasing secure phones.\n\n\nHear hear! I completely agree that we need to work quickly to\nestablish alternatives to the government's Clinton Clipper. As Brad\nTempleton and others have noted, once the Clipper becomes ensconced in\nenough phones there will be enormous pressure to make it the *legal*\nstandard, and it will become the \"market* standard as well. (There is\na lot of confusion in the proposal about whether the use of Clipper is\nmandated, about whether non-escrow alternatives will be allowed, etc.)\n\n(There are also unclear issues about how hard, or how illegal, it will\nbe to make \"workalikes\" which meet the standard but which generate\nphony or untappable keys...I'm sure the next several weeks will see\nthese issues thrashed out in this and other groups.)\n\nMeanwhile, I'd be interested to hear RSA Data Security's reaction.\nOften criticized in this group for their licensing policies (the usual\ncomplaints about MailSafe costing too much, at $125 or so, and the\ngeneral issue of software patents...), we may find that *allying*\nourselves with RSA is the best thing we can do. What's a mere\nlicensing fee when our liberty may be at stake? (If everyone who\nwanted true security paid, say, $100 for a lifetime use of all of\nRSA's patents--which expire in the period 1998-2002, or so--then RSA\nwould make tons of money and be happy, I'm sure. A small price to pay.\nFor those to whom $100 sounds like too much, I'm sure the actual terms\ncould be different, spread out over several years, whatever. To me,\nit's a small price to pay.)\n\nStrong crypto means strong privacy. Escrowing keys, sending copies of\nkeys to large databases, and splitting keys into two 40-bit pieces,\nall done with secret and non-analyzable protocols and algorithms, is\n*NOT* strong crypto!\n\nWhatever some of us may think about the abstract principles of\npatenting number theory applications, this minor issue pales in\ncomparison with the potential dangers of the Clipper proposal (note\nthat I said \"potential\"...we'll presumably learn more in the coming\nmonths).\n\nThe RSA algorithms are at least public, have been analyzed and\nattacked for years, and source code is available (to better ensure no\ndeliberate weakenesses or trapdoors).\n\nI know of a number of groups putting together voice encryption systems\nusing off-the-shelf hardware (like Soundblaster boards for the PC) and\nCELP-type software. The new generations of PCs, using fast 486s and\nPentiums are fast enough to do real-time voice encryption. Combined\nwith Diffie-Hellman key exchange, this should provide an alternative\nto the Clipper system.\n\nOf course, we don't really know if the Administration proposes to\noutlaw competing systems. (It seems to me that their goal of tapping\nterrorists, child pornographers, and Hilary bashers would be thwarted\nif low-cost alternatives to Clipper proliferated. Not to defend child\npornographers or terrorists, but limiting basic freedoms to catch a\nfew criminals is not the American way of doing things. End of soapbox\nmode.)\n\nI suggest we in these groups set aside any differences we may have had\nwith RSA (and don't look at me....I have both MacPGP *and* a fully\nlegal copy of \"MailSafe\"!) and instead work with them as quickly as we can.\n\nRSA?, Jim?, are you listening?\n\n-Tim May\n\nP.S.

I suspect that NSA\nhas put a fairly strong encryption algorithm in this wiretap chip of theirs,\nprobably at least as strong as (say) DES in OFB-mode.  Unfortunately, the\nexistence of the key-registry system seems to make possible all kinds of\npossible attacks at a small fraction of the expense of trying to build (say)\na DES keysearch machine.\n \n   As originally described, it sounded like any police / court combination\ncould acquire the key for a given chip.  I hope that's not the case, since\nit would imply a glaring hole.  (How much does it cost to find *one* crooked\njodge and *one* crooked cop?  Especially for a foreign intelligence agency\nor organized crime boss?)  However, even if more intelligent schemes are used\nto allow access to the unencrypted phone conversations, there will be weak-\nnesses.  They may be very expensive, and very difficult.  But who would\ntrust his/her confidential information to an encryption scheme that, for\n(say) $100,000 could by cracked one time in a hundred?  (DES, for all the\ncomplaints about a 56-bit key, would probably cost several million dollars\nto build a keysearch machine for.)\n \n   How many million dollars would the confidential phone messages of\nthe GM headquarters be worth to Nissan, Chrysler, or Audi?

Please feel free to distribute this and my other messages\non Clipper.\n\nThe name of the encryption algorithm is \"Skipjack.\"\n\nMartin Hellman had written\n\n                and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part\n                message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK\n                producing\n\n                     E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}\n\nTo which I responded:\n\n        My understanding is that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK (called the\n        \"family key\") and that the decrypt key corresponding to SK is held by\n        law enforcement.  Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this?\n\nI was correct in that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK.  However, Skipjack\nbeing a single-key system, there is, of course, not a separate decrypt key\nfor the family key SK.\n\n        The unit key, also called the \"chip key,\" is generated from the\n        serial number N as follows.  Let N1, N2, and N3 be 64 bit blocks\n        derived from N, and let S1 and S2 be two 80-bit seeds used as keys.\n        Compute the 64-bit block\n\n                R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1]\n\n        (Note that this is like using the DES in triple encryption mode with\n        two keys.)  Similarly compute blocks R2 and R3 starting with N2 and N3.\n        (I'm unlear about whether the keys S1 and S2 change.  The fact that\n        they're called seeds suggests they might.)  Then R1, R2, and R3 are\n        concatenated together giving 192 bits.  The first 80 bits  form K1 and\n        the next 80 bits form K2.  The remaining bits are discarded.\n\nThe seeds S1 and S2 do not change.   The whole process is performed on\na laptop computer, and S1 and S2 are supplied by two independent people\nso that no one person knows both.  The same S1 and S2 are used during\nan entire \"programming session\" to generate keys for a stream of serial\nnumbers.  Everything is discarded at the end (the computer could be\nthrown out if desired).\n\nThe serial number is 30 bits and the values N1, N2, and N3 are formed\nby padding the serial number with fixed 34-bit blocks (separate padding\nfor each value).\n\nThe resulting keys K1 and K2 are output onto separate floppy disks, paired\nup with their serial number.  Each pair is stored in a separate file.  The\nfloppy disks are taken away by two separate people on behalf of the two\nescrow agencies.\n\nDorothy Denning\ndenning@cs.georgetown.edu\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nI am sure more technical detail will be known when time goes by.\nPlease remark, that in posting this, I do not automatically agree\nwith it's contents and implications. So don't swamp my mailbox :-)\n\nI just think this is an valuable addition to the less than technical\ndiscussion that is rising here. And, no, I don't mind if you call\nS1 and S2 'backdoor', as I could imagine the key-generation process\nworking without these seeds and the dependency of K1,K2 from the\nSerial-Number.\n\n\nFriendly greetings,\n\n\tGermano Caronni\n-- \nInstruments register only through things they're designed to register.\nSpace still contains infinite unknowns.\n                                                              PGP-Key-ID:341027\nGermano Caronni caronni@nessie.cs.id.ethz.ch   FD560CCF586F3DA747EA3C94DD01720F\n"

Knowing that WE have let our law enforcement agencies\nseize our property against the Fifth Amendment of OUR Constitution tells me that\nwe are absolving ourselves of our responsibility for SELF-GOVERNANCE.

WE have allowed\nthem to take too much power from the people of this nation.  That situation has\nto be changed.\n\nAllowing the law enforcement agencies to use the seized property to pay-off drug\ninformants who lie and continue to deal in drugs is tantamount to making a pact\nwith the Devil himself.  It's a vicious cycle.  The law enforcement agencies are\nmotivated to seize property to fund their own activities.  And having no easy\nway for the citizen to regain the property intact once taken gives even more\nincentive for the agencies to take property.\n\nIt's also interesting to note that two months ago Rush Limbaugh said that\nClinton would have the \"plumbers\" out in force shortly.

The general setup is designed so that when users \n\tconnect they send a private key encrypted using the system public\n\tkey and the user's public-private keypair is used to wrap the\n\tone-time session keys used for encrypting the files on disk.  The\n\tresult of this is that even if I reveal the system private key it\n\tis impossible for anyone to gain access to the files stored on the\n\tmachine.  What is possible is for someone to use the revealed\n\tsystem private key to entice users into revealing thier personal\n\tprivate keys during the authentication sequence.\n\nQuestions:\n\n\tDoes the fact that the system private key does not provide any\n\tinformation useful for a search give me any protection as far as\n\tbeing coerced to reveal the key?

If I talk to someone who has one\nof these phones, presumably there will be an automatically negotiated\nkey generated.  I'm not trying to decipher the record of the\nconversation to know what was said, I use it as a known plaintext to\nrecover the backdoor represented by the header, but I know what the\nheader says for conversations I participate in.  Even worse, if the\nphones in a series have related keys, I can buy a phone/chip from the\nsame production lot.  Then I can recover its keys, either elegantly by\ntalking to myself, or by brute force analysis of the actual chip, then\napply the key generation process with those seeds to find the target\nkeys.)\n\n    Hmmm!

But this\nstrategy wouldn't get the stuff admitted in court.  (At least, not\nin the near term.)\n\nIn other words, near as I can tell, the thing that makes such evidence\ninadmissable is the interception without a warrant, not the attempt to\ninterpret what was intercepted without a warrant.  I'd be surprised\nthat archiving data without consent would be interpreted as anything\nbut analogous to a wiretap by the courts.\n\nNote that that doesn't mean I think it won't be done if technically\nfeasible.  Just as I'm sure many wiretaps are done now without\nwarrants, just to fish for avenues to investigate.  So in the future,\nstart surveilance, start archiving data, trump up some probable cause,\ndecrypt post-facto after the warrant is in hand, and the investigation\ngets a boost from data that, sadly, won't ever be presented to a jury.\n\nWhile I'm posting...  for an interesting cautionary tale projecting this\narchiving scenario to extremes, read \"Lacey and his Friends\", a\ncollection of sf stories by David Drake.  The US starts down the\nslippery slope by archiving *everyghing*.  But don't worry folks, it's\nstored in a secure repository where nobody but LEAs with warrants can\nget to it.  And by the way, we'll be installing cameras on all major\nstreets.  Hey, this is nothing new, we already have cameras in banks and\nteller machines, don't we?\n\nAnd then we'll pass laws requiring cameras covering *all* public\nplaces.  Then in some private places.  Then we'll make it a crime ever\nto be out of range of a camera, except in legally licensed privacy\ncubicles.  Only alone.  And with a thorough body search before and\nafter.  But, see, there's still a right to privacy.  We haven't\ncurtailed any rights, not really.  And just think how much easier it'd\nbe to solve crimes in such a situation: just obtain a warrant, put on a\nVR helmet and take a walk down memory lane.\n\nAnd hey, nobody'll be tracking *you* or *me*, no need to be self-conscious.\n\nAfter all, if you're not doing anything illegal...\n\nFunny, though.  While speeding and the radar detector industry became\npretty much a thing of the past, somehow all this didn't elminate all\ncrime in the story.  And somehow, politicians got exemptions on grounds\nof national security, and rich corporations got exemptions for their\nexecs on grounds of industrial espionage and the preservation of\ncompetition.  And not everybody was exactly happy with the system.  \nI can't imagine why.\n\n--\nWayne Throop   throopw%sheol@concert.net\n               throop%aurgate@concert.net\n"

Tell us, what happens if I were to say OK, I want to have\nsomething else.  If the law enforcement wants my traffic, they can record\nit, then get a search warrant, and get the keys FROM ME, just like they\nwould the keys to a stout private safe, etc. (Lets say I suspect that\nthere is a way to trivially crack this at the Fed level, with no warrant,\nsay for NSA scanning for keywords, etc., and the government has abused\ngreat power in the past...).\n\nSo I say \"Mr Vendor, I want something different, independent.  I am\na paranoid sort, ya understand...\".\n\nWill the result be \"Sorry, without Government permission, we cannot sell\nyou anything secure\", or would it be \"Sorry, we know which side our\nbread is buttered on, we cannot sell except to government people, law\nenforcement, and 'special' people...\".\n\nWhat, in your opinion, would be the chances of \"sure, we will sell you\nthis secure system ... be happy to...\"\n\nAlso, please be so kind as to tell us what the plans are for private\nencryption of, say files transferred by modem, or FTP, or data stored\non disk?  SURELY you have a feel for what the administration is planning\nfor us people on that....  With your rather intimate relationship with\nthe FBI, NSA, etc. you must CERTAINLY have an idea.  You are surely\nnot going to say \"the people are not to know, until it is too late...\"\nThis IS supposed to be government of the people by the PEOPLE, isn't\nit?  That is, the people ARE the government's BOSSES?  The BOSSES\nwant to know what the *@()#*&(@ is going on here...\n\nYou see, I am kind of nervous, because in the last month or so, I have\nseen a non-stop stream of ideas coming out of Wash DC that at least\nappear VERY STRONGLY to have a common trait to limit privacy (freedom\nfrom Govt eavesdropping), and the ability to defend ourselves against\nviolent attack (no, 911 is *NOT* good enough for 'common folk', they\narrive only in time to clean up the mess: I would be DEAD if I had to\ndepend on 911...).   You see, with all that talk about National smart\nID cards, limiting of encryption to 'government approved', denial of\nmeans to effective personal defense (EIGHT bills in congress right now),\nit looks an AWFULLY lot like the whole thing is to be able to trace\nEVERY ACTIVITY of an individual from cradle to grave.  All it would take\nis requiring that National ID card to be used in all transactions...\nand with no effective data protection, and with the people suitably\ndisarmed, there would not be a helluva lot they could do about it, now\nwould there?  All in the name of the War on the Constitu ... er ...\ndrugs, and of course that catch word 'terrorists'.  What is wrong with\ngood OLD-FASHIONED POLICE WORK to build a case?  They don't want to\nhave to be burdened to leave the office, it seems...\n\nPlease read the Bill of Rights (first ten amendments to the US\nConstitution) and tell us how you can reconcile this Big Brother-ish\npolicy of the Administration (always for a 'crisis' of some kind, isn't\nit?) with that Bill of Rights in the context of the people who wrote\nit?\n\nReassure us - please... (or is that no longer regarded as necessary,\nseeing as apparantly the people have NO input on this agenda, the\nAdministration preferring to make all the DECISIONS in secret, then\nspringing it on us...).  Doesn't sound much like ... by the PEOPLE\nto me.  I cannot help notice that the congress people involved were\nNOT mentioned on the press release.  I find that more than a little\nbit curious, don't you?  I sure would like to know who to not vote\nfor come election time...\n\nYes, I am upset.  I feel you are a part of this, because I recall it\nwas you that was posting HEAVILY in favor of a very similar idea (could\nhave been the SAME thing, it was so close) a few months ago...  I\nalso recall it was not well received.  Apparantly powers-that-be\nreally didn't care (or were not told, or both).\n\nFrom what I see, Clipper will ONLY be useful for conversations I don't\nwant the neighborhood kid listening in on.  Any SERIOUS security I don't\nthink I would want to trust it a bit.  Might as well use cleartext.\nCertainly corporations would be rather dumb to depend on this for serious\ntrade-secret data, especially if millions depended on that security.\nGiven enough money, one could BUY any keys they wanted.  Buy a crooked\njudge, and a crooked cop.   Given a few hundred thou, they wouldn't be\nhard to find.  So, we end up with only criminals, terrorists, and the\nGovernment with real security, and the ability to eavesdrop.  You know\nthe first two, if they are serious, ain't going to use this thing for\nTHEIR communications.  I bet the government won't, either (except perhaps\nto order a pizza).\n\nTell us, will that be prima face evidence of criminal activity,\nsomeone not using the 'government approved' methods?  That just a desire\nto have PRIVACY is no longer regarded as a legitimate right of an\nunconnected citizen?  Will that be grounds for a fly-through-the-door\nraid, and confiscation of all one's equipment, as 'terrorist tools',\nusing civil forfeiture, so there will be no inconvenient need to\nPROVE any wrongdoing on the part of the citizen?\n\nI have yet another question, are we going to see articles in all the\npublic magazines, consisting of soothing text telling us how great\nthis is, how nice the government is by LETTING us have this illusion\nof privacy?  That the government is going to be so kind as to let\nus 'sort of' exercise a RIGHT?  What you want to bet that I am\ncorrect here?\n\nPlease answer these questions.  As citizens of the United States, we\nhava a RIGHT to know what our Government plans to 'let' us have\nout of the goodness of their hearts...\n\nFunny thing, though - with all these proposals, I don't feel ONE BIT\nsafer from drug dealers, terrorists, or a common street thug.

Since we have to trust the escrow companies\nanyway, it does not weaken the system to have the keys be generated from\nrandom seeds entered by the escrow agents.  And since the algorithm for\nkey-generation is public (modulo Skipjack secrecy) then in principle an\nagent could challenge the procedure, ask for S1 and S2 to be exposed, and\nrun his own independent calculation of U1 and U2 to verify that that is\nwhat is actually being put onto the floppies.\n\nAnd yes, there are many ways in which failures to follow this scheme could\nbe hard to check.  The laptop probably will not really be destroyed each\ntime.  Hidden cameras in the ceiling could see the S1 and S2 entered by\nthe trusted escrow agents.  Back doors in the chip could allow U to be\nrecovered.  Heck, each chip could be recorded with the same U, ignoring\nwhat was on the floppy.\n\nHal Finney\n"

I have\n>not yet seen it mentioned in any of a dozen places it might have been\n>reported, but I could have easily missed it.\n\nPlease let us know if you get a solid answer to the question of legality\nof other strong cryptosystems.   So far any references I have seen\nhave been weasel-words (\"more plans in the future, etc\"), but nothing\nthat could be taken as a \"NO (strong crypto will NOT be outlawed)\".  I\nhave heard (not verified) that the Crime Bill before Congress has\nlanguage that either requires escrow of keys, or that will regard\nall systems 'unapproved' for public use, like strong cryptosystems\nnot trivially broken by the Govt, or without escrowed keys\nwhich one cannot readily change (read: use being only permitted by\nfolks with 'special' connections, or government agencies) as either\n'terrorist tools' or 'drug dealers tools'.  Not outlawed SPECIFICALLY\nbut by added Civil Forfeiture powers, and clever wording, EFFECTIVELY\noutlawed for all intents and purposes.\n\nNow, for some idle speculation ... for those who don't care, hit 'n' now.\n\nCrypto being EFFECTIVELY outlawed could be done without SPECIFICALLY\noutlawing ANY class of crypto systems.  For example, a crowbar, hammers,\nscrewdrivers, and such can be regarded as 'burglar tools' pretty much\nat the whim of the authorities, based primarily on the individual\npossessing them in the car, etc. not being in a trade that makes routine\nuse of these tools.  In a like manner, one who has no 'legitimate need'\n(gov't definition) for strong crypto software or systems, and is caught\nusing them, might find themselves in possession of 'terrorist tools'.\nIn other words, if one is not working for a corporation with extremely\nsensitive commercial data that warrants (in the Fed's opinion) strong\nsecurity, or a government agency, and securing only work-related data,\nnot personal data, one will most likely be nailed on this if discoverd.\nA personal desire for 'privacy' most certainly will not be regarded as\na 'legitimate NEED': \n\"Why do you want such strong security, especially from 'legitimate law\nenforcement'? An individual with 'legitimate' endeavors would not be so\nconcerned - government is not in the business of revealing your personal\nsecrets to the public... so you must be trying to conceal or planning\nto conceal some unlawful or criminal activity...  DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING\nTO HIDE, HMMMM?\"\nI expect that initially there will be some people selected either at\nrandom, or who happen to have been 'troublemakers' for the purposes of\n'making an example' for those who think the Feds are not SERIOUS about\nthis... (mega ':-('s)\n\nOne asking about a 'right' to privacy will probably get a response that\nthere is no constitutional right for privacy spelled out AS SUCH (an\nargument used in the abortion debate):  \"You do NOT have a right to have\nsecurity that 'Legitimate Law Enforcement cannot break'\" (as suggested\nin the Clipper Press Release).\n\nThis, in a nutshell, is what I find so extremely frightening.  Not only\nfor crypto systems, as in this case, but for the precident it will set,\nlaying the groundwork for future erosions of privacy (escrow of both\nsafe-deposit box keys - 'master' keys or combinations for privately\nowned safes, and so on.  WHY NOT?)...\n\nI cannot think of a better way to make an 'end-run' around those\n'inconvenient' parts of the US Constitution.  A law cannot be easily\ndeclared unconstitutional, if it there IS NO SPECIFIC LAW.  It would\nsimply be a minor extension of the RICO statutes or WoD policies. A\nsimple policy decision, just like so many of the gun regulations are\nmainly BATF policy decisions...  The Conversation of the Fed agents\nwould go something like:\n\n\"We are gonna seize your home, your computers, your car, your bank\naccount, (you don't have to undress and give us yer clothes, unless you\nhave a floppy in yer pocket) because they are all connected with your\nacquisition, transport, and use of 'terrorist tools' and/or 'drug dealers\ntools' - part of the WoD or against terrorism, ya unnerstand... no\ndecent American Subject would be against these noble causes...\".\n\n\"Note we are not accusing YOU of any wrong-doing ... we are only saying\nyour HOME, COMPUTERS, CAR, BANK ASSETS are connected with wrong-doing\nSOMEHOW - they housed, transported, and funded these 'terrorist tools'.\nOnly a civil matter ...  <heh-heh> ... We had this 'tip'...<grin>\".\n\n\"Therefore, the Constitutional Protection on Individual rights do NOT\napply - we are 'arresting' the tainted PROPERTY... not YOU...<evil grin>\".\n\n\"If you wish to deposit a BOND, hire some attorneys, and go to court to\nPROVE the innocence of this property (that they are not 'terrorist tools'\nand again to prove they are not also 'drug dealers tools'), go ahead,\nwe have no problem with that!  'Course, with your bank assets seized,\nno car, computer, or home, (probably no job, too) and your\nless-than-limitless resources, you might run into some minor practical\ndifficulties <grin>...\".\n\nTHAT is what has me going so damned ballistic...  It is EXACTLY how\nthe logic goes when someone gives a 'tip' that your home has been\nused to store DRUGS...  Note no trace of drugs need to be found on\nthe property... only some bozo who will say 'yup.  I stored stuff in\nthat dude's house...' (probably to get out of a 10 year sentence for\ndealing).  Much more cost effective to let him walk, to bust another\nday, and hit the jackpot with YOUR assets...\n\nOb Disclaimer (of course)...\n\nOk, note that I am not a lawyer, and can only base these speculations\non what I have read/heard/been told regarding past Civil Forfeiture\ncases, and how they are used to augment the budgets of assorted agencies,\nor to get 'cooperation' of folks who just want to be left alone, or who\ndo not wish to be put in a risky situation (especially in areas where\nthey are denied either meaningful police protection, AND the means to be\nable to even pretend to defend themselves, as is quite common back East,\nlike NJ, MA, NYC, Wa DC, or out West in CA).  These people have the\nchoice of cowering under the government boot, or cowering under threats\nof pissed off drug dealing gang-bangers... helpless in either case...\nAll behind some dude who drops a dime on you for his gain, or behind\nthe Feds wanting to 'make an example'...  Civil Forfeiture being the 'hook'.\n\nPoint is, are these speculations way out of line, or are they all too\ntypical, and if so, does the extension to crypto and just about anything\nthat the Feds regard as 'inconvenient' seem reasonable?

The redundancy hereby introduced \ncan be used to detect tampered Clipper signals where some public enemy \nreplaced the L.E. block by random data. \n\nAnd of course the L.E. block would be used to initialise the encryption \nof the user data so that at the receiving end the correct L.E. block must \nbe processed in order to have any chance of getting the plaintext back. \n\nFor those of you who might want to mangle the L.E. block (e.g. by xor-ing \na constant pattern) on the transmission line and restore it before feeding \nit into the receiving Crippler Chip I would add further encrypted copies \nof this block (perhaps created by repeated application of the encryption \nalgorithm or so) at regular intervals during the transmission. If the \nreceiving chip detects a mismatch it must assume that the line is bad and \nit will cease to work; in your own interest you are protected from getting \nfaulty plaintext, you know -- it's just like a checksum for your own \nsafety ;-(. \n\nThe `monitoring agencies' won't have the famous black box which is needed \nfor actual decryption and will be kept by the FBI; but nothing prevents \nthem from using special boxes which will do the redundancy check for the \nserial number block and consistency checks on the embedded L.E. blocks \nwithin the transmission. These boxes will turn a red light on as soon as \nthey detect a bitstream that violates the correct protocol.\n\nSo don't anyone think that you can use the chip and fool L.E. about the \ntapping key -- I bet the developpers have provided much better checks \nthan those suggested above. Of course it's absolutely crucial that the \nalgorithms (and protocols) remain secret.

Given:\n\n1. the purpose of the one-time pad is to give unbreakable security,\nand the expense of key distribution etc., imply that the clients\nreally do want that level of security\n\n2. These same people want to keep P a secret\n\nI find it hard to believe that Eve might happen to have a copy of P\nlying around.\n\n(I am aware that the same argument applies to Eve knowing even a small\npart of the message, but Eve must know EXACTLY where (which bytes) in\nC her known susequence starts, or the result will be garbled. I find\nthis at least as surprising.)\n\nBack to the question:\n\nIf I had the resources to use a one-time-pad for such transmissions, I\nwould also append a Message Authentication Code to the message, using up\nthe next bits of the one-time-pad as the key perhaps. Your original\nquestion basically asked whether there was any way to authenticate the\nmessage with the same degree of security as the Pad itself provided,\nand I don't know the answer. However, I would propose the following\nfor discussion.\n\nAlice and Bob have an arbitrary number of secret, random bits to\nshare, which Eve doesn't know. She finds them out (effectively) by\nknowing some P and the corresponding C. It is the fact that they\nCORRESPOND that causes the problem. If a message authentication code was to\nbe created using some one-time-pad operation such that Eve could not\nknow which parts of the MAC were affected by which parts of the input,\nshe would be unable to forge a MAC to correspond.\n\nWhat is required is a non-linear combiner of parts of the message.\n(Non-linear so that simply xoring or subtracting or whatever doesn't\nhave exactly the same effect).\n\nNow, at the end of the encrypted message C, Alice appends a n-bit MAC\ncomputed as follows (S2 means the next full chunk of the one time pad):\n  1. compute C2 = P xor S2, and pad to an n-bit boundary with more of S\n  2. break C2 into n-bit chunks\n  3. set MAC to 0 (initialisation vector)\n  4. for i in each chunk sequentially\n       set MAC = MAC NLOP C2[i]\n\nAt the end of this process MAC is the Message Authentication Code.\n\n(Bob verifies the MAC in the obvious manner; he recovers the\nplaintext P, then uses some more of his pad to reproduce the MAC in\nthe same manner.)\n\nNLOP is the non-linear operator, and there is the rub. The simplest\nnon-linear operator I can think of is an S-box; that is, have a fixed\n(even published) permutation of the n-bit integers, an indexable table\ncalled Sbox, and use:\n  x NLOP y = x xor Sbox[y].\n\nPractically speaking, I think this solves your problem, as Eve never\nsees the intermediate output C2, and hence can't deduce S2 or perform any valid\nsubstitution on it.\n\nAlso practically speaking, you want the MAC to be fairly large, say 32\nbits, but you might not want a 4 gigabyte (say) S-box, so you might\nwork on 4 byte-sized S-boxes, but I think that is an irrelevant detail\nfor the discussion at hand.\n\nWho will be first to point out my errors, or give me a pointer to some\nliterature?\n--\nGreg Rose                 Australian Computing and Communications Institute\nggr@acci.com.au                                              +61 18 174 842\n`Use of the standard phrase \"HIJACKED\" may be inadvisable' -- CAA\n"

I recieved in the mail today the spec sheets on the mil.\nspec version of Exar's XR-2240 timer/counter chip. It is stable down to -50 C\nand sucks very little power. They show an application for a ultra-long time\ndelay (up to several years depending on the RC time constant). In this\napplication, they have two of them cascaded together. The reset and trigger\npins of both chips are tied together and the timebase of the second chip is\ndisabled. In this configuration, the output is high when the system is reset.\nWhen triggered, the output goes low and stays that way for a total of 65,536 x\nthe timing cycle of the first chip. The total timing cycle of the two chips can\nbe programmed from To = 256 x R x C to 65,536 x R x C in 256 steps by selecting\nany combination of the counter outputs to the timer output. The beauty of it\nis, the timebase chip would only have to have a 100uF timing cap and a 391K\nresistor for 39.1 seconds per timing cycle. So I can get a maximum of\n2,562,457.6 seconds between timing cycles (39.1 x 65,536 or about 29 days !)\nOf course, that's much more than I need (14 days). But the counter allows for\n256 binary steps that can be selected for the output for the 'pellet puker'.\nAfter the first 14 days and it trips, it would reset its self for the next 14\nday timing cycle and so forth.\n\nPower is still a problem though. A few ideas that you suggested was to bury the\nelectronics in a hole dug in the snow (as an insulator) and put the pellet\npuker up on a tower above the estimated snow fall with a solar panel on it to\nkeep a charge on a lithium battery pack. I like that idea ;-) This thing has to\nwork for at least six weeks for three samples and the gas valves are 12 volts\nto spit the pellets out onto the snow. Anyway, I ordered the XR-2240's to see\nwhat I can do with them. Should be interesting (as long as I'm not the one that\nhas to go digging up the pellets in the middle of Antartica freezing my buns\noff ;-)\n\nThanks again everyone...\n\n-=-= Wes =-=-\n"

Use a probe with a 10M resistor (like a scope probe) connected to the\ninput of a small audio amp w/speaker.  If you find line-level input to both\nchips, one of the chips is bad and can probably replaced pretty easily.  \n\nIf you want to pick off a near-line-level signal, suitable for feeding to an\noutboard amp, the outer legs of the volume control pot will often be good\nenough.  This is *before* the volume control (and usually before the tone and\nbalance controls too).  If you take off from the center and ground legs of\nthe volume pot, this will be after the volume control (but again, probably \nbefore the other controls).  \n\nIf the unit is a modern type with an electronic volume control chip, you should\nprobably forget the whole thing. \n\n\t--- Jamie Hanrahan, Kernel Mode Systems, San Diego CA\nInternet:  jeh@cmkrnl.com  Uucp: uunet!cmkrnl!jeh  CIS: 74140,2055\n"

Several\npeople responded with good information, but I don't think I communicated \nexactly what I am looking for.\n\tI'm working on a custom I/O device that will communicate with a host\nvia RS-232.  My custom circuitry will use an 80C186EB or EC CPU and require\nabout 64K of RAM (preferably FLASH RAM).  In looking around, I see that lots\nof people have engineered UART-CPU-ROM-RAM subsystems that are ready to be\ninterfaced to your custom I/O devices.  It's been done so much, that it \nwould be best if I can avoid reinventing a system.  It just needs to use\nan 80C186 (or 188) CPU, and be able to load a program from the host then \ntransfer control to that program.  Well, there's one other thing the ROM\nneeds to know how to do.  It should have routines to send and receive bytes\nto/from the host, that utilize the hardware control lines (DTR,RTS,DTS,CTS).\nEverything I've seen is in the $200.00 and up range.  That's too much for\nthis application.  I need something around $100.00.  The CPU has the UART\nbuilt-in, so you're only looking at a few chips.

It should also be noted that at \nlocations where water is plentiful, the cooling towers are only used part\ntime, when the discharge temperature would exceed some release limit.\nIt was once thought that the warm discharge water was damaging to fish.\nFishermen know that is thoroughly incorrect.

The noise you hear is due to the momentary\nopening and closing of the path.\n\nThe noiseless way of transfering audio is to ground the circuit.  In high\nimpedance audio circuits a resistive \"T\" is constructed close to characteristic\nimpedance of the circuit.  Grounding the imputs (connected to the T) transfers\nthe audio.\n\nIn low impedance circuits transformers are usually used, and the inputs are\nshorted out or grounded.  Secondaries are paralleled at the characteristic\nimpedance.\n\nSometimes if it is necessary to actually switch audio, a second contact is used\nto momentarily short the circuit output for the duration of the switching time.\n\nTelephone relays are handy, because contacts can be adjusted to \"Make before\nbreak and Vica Versa\" but I haven't seen any of these for years.\n\nNowadys switching is done electronically with OP amps, etc.\n\nA novel circuit I used to build was a primitive \"optical isolator\".. It consists\nof a resistive photocell and a lamp, all packaged in a tube.  When the lamp is\noff the cell is high resistance.  Turn the lamp on and the resistance lowers\npassing the audio.  Once again this device in a \"T\" switches the audio.  Varying\nthe lamp resistance give a remote volume control.  Use 2 variable resisters and\nyou have a mixer!\n\nLots of luck!\n-- \n73, Tom\n================================================================================\nTom Wagner, Audio Visual Technician.

What the supply must do,\nif presented with a load which would draw more than 1A, given the\nsupply voltage, is reduce the voltage so that the current will equal\none amp.  Thus, if we were to short the thing with the ammeter, we\nshould read one amp.  If we measure the current through a 1 ohm \nresistor at 12V, we should read one amp (and the output voltage, by\nnecessity, must be 1V.\n\nThe only basic idea we have seen for the current limiter involves\na circuit which will pull current off of the base of the output \npower transistor, and therefore reduce the output.\n\nSo, does anybody have any ideas we could work from?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nAndy Collins, KC6YEY\nacollins@uclink.berkeley.edu\n\nps: If anybody wants to flame this as a stupid project, I agree fully,\n    but I still have to do it, its graded ;^)\n\n"

You're feeling the greater rate of heat loss from an object\n(your hand) which is kept much warmer than its surroundings.  In the case\nof an object with no significant internal heat production, this will\naffect how quickly it comes into equilibrium with its surroundings (if\nit started out not in equilibrium with them) but won't affect the final\ntemperature.\n\nFor the same reason, windchill affects whether you will freeze but not\nwhether water will freeze.\n-- \nSVR4 resembles a high-speed collision   | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology\nbetween SVR3 and SunOS.    - Dick Dunn  |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry\n"

I've seen red mask,\nbut most that I've seen are green.\n\nA bakelite board will look brown in colour, and, if the solder mask\nis put on, looks like a brown board with green 'paint' on either side\n(or just one side) of the board.\nA fibreglass board will look green from the side, because the green\nsolder-mask makes the board appear that colour. If you got a fibreglass\nboard with no mask, it would be a whitish-grey colour.\nTeflon boards do exist, as well... but I'm not sure about that one.\n\nI'd guess the stuff they invented for solder mask was green, so they're\nnot about to change.

I had an ENT (ear/nose/throat) exam, and\npassed.  In fact, my hearing is quite good considering I don't take as\ngood of care of my hearing as I should.\n\nHer reaction is normal.  If it is tinnitus, chances are good she'll\nbegin to not even notice it.  \n\nThis info is taken mostly from a few \"experts\", my own experience, and\nsome readings (sorry, it was a few years back and don't have any\nspecifics handy).\n\nJT\n"

Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port\n        2. X terminals\n        3. NeXT\n        4. Silicon Graphics\n        5. IBM RS/6000\n\t6. Other stuff\n\n    1. Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port\n\n\tIf you've got a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboard\n\t(Sun, HP, DEC, etc.) then you're going to have a hard time finding\n\ta vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard.  If your workstation\n\truns the X window system, you're in luck.  You can buy a cheap used\n\tPC, hook your expensive keyboard up to it, and run a serial cable\n\tto your workstation.  Then, run a program on the workstation to read\n\tthe serial port and generate fake X keyboard events.\n\n\tThe two main programs I've found to do this are KT and A2X.\n\n\ta2x is a sophisticated program, capable of controlling the mouse, and\n\teven moving among widgets on the screen.  It requires a server\n\textension (XTEST, DEC-XTRAP, or XTestExtension1).  To find out if your\n\tserver can do this, run 'xdpyinfo' and see if any of these strings\n\tappear in the extensions list.  If your server doesn't have this,\n\tyou may want to investigate compiling X11R5, patchlevel 18 or later,\n\tor bugging your vendor.\n\n\tkt is a simpler program, which should work with unextended X servers.\n\tAnother program called xsendevent also exists, but I haven't seen it.\n\n\tBoth a2x and kt are available via anonymous ftp from soda.berkeley.edu.\n\n    2. X terminals\n\n\tAlso, a number of X terminals (NCD, Tektronics, to name a few) use\n\tPC-compatible keyboards.  If you have an X terminal, you may be all\n\tset.  Try it out with a normal PC keyboard before you go through the\n\ttrouble of buying an alternative keyboard.  Also, some X terminals add\n\textra buttons -- you may need to keep your original keyboard around\n\tfor the once-in-a-blue-moon that you have to hit the Setup key.\n\n    3. NeXT\n\n\tNeXT had announced that new NeXT machines will use the Apple Desktop\n\tBus, meaning any Mac keyboard will work.  Then, they announced they\n\twere cancelling their hardware production.  If you want any kind of\n\tupgrade for an older NeXT, do it now!\n\n    4. Silicon Graphics\n\n\tSilicon Graphics has announced that their newer machines (Indigo^2 and\n\tbeyond) will use standard PC-compatible keyboards and mice.  I don't\n\tbelieve this also applies to the Power Series machines.  It's not\n\tpossible to upgrade an older SGI to use PC keyboards, except by\n\tupgrading the entire machine.  Contact your SGI sales rep for more\n\tdetails.\n\n    5. IBM RS/6000\n\n\tIBM RS/6000 keyboards are actually similar to normal PC keyboards.  ||\n\tUnfortunately, you can't just plug one in.  You need two things: a  ||\n\tcable converter to go from the large PC keyboard connector to the   ||\n\tsmaller PS/2 style DIN-6, and a new device driver for AIX.  Believe ||\n\tit or not, IBM wrote this device driver recently, I used it, and it ||\n\tworks.  However, they don't want me to redistribute it.  I've been  ||\n\ttold Judy Hume (512) 823-6337 is a potential contact.  If you learn ||\n\tanything new, please send me e-mail.\t\t\t\t    ||\n    \n    6. Other stuff\n\n\tSome vendors here (notably: Health Care Keyboard Co. and AccuCorp)\n\tsupport some odd keyboard types, and may be responsive to your\n\tqueries regarding supporting your own weird computer.  If you can\n\tget sufficient documention about how your keyboard works (either\n\tfrom the vendor, or with a storage oscilloscope), you may be in\n\tluck.  Contact the companies for more details.\n\n\nApple Adjustable Keyboard\n    Apple Computer, Inc.\n    Sales offices all over the place.\n\n    Availability: February, 1993\n    Price: $219\n    Supports: Mac only\n\n    Apple has recently announced their new split-design keyboard.  The\n    keyboard has one section for each hand, and the sections rotate\n    backward on a hinge.  The sections do not tilt upward.  The keys are\n    arranged in a normal QWERTY fashion.\n\n    The main foldable keyboard resembles a normal Apple Keyboard.\n    A separate keypad contains all the extended key functions.\n\n    The keyboard also comes with matching wrist rests, which are not\n    directly attachable to the keyboard.\n\n    As soon as soda comes back up, I'll have a detailed blurb from\n    TidBITS available there.\n\n\nFlexPro Keyboard\n    Key Tronic\n    Phone: 800-262-6006\n    Possible contact: Denise Razzeto, 509-927-5299\n    Sold by many clone vendors and PC shops\n\n    Availability: Spring, 1993 (?)\n    Price: $489 (?)\n    Supports: PC only (highly likely)\n\n    Keytronic apparently showed a prototype keyboard at Comdex.

I have a fourteen year old daugter who experienced\na seizure on November 3, 1992 at 6:45AM after eating Kellog's Frosted\nFlakes.  She is perfectly healthy, had never experienced anything like\nthis before, and there is no history of seizures in either side of the\nfamily.  All the tests (EEG, MRI, EKG) came out negative so the decision\nwas made to do nothing and just wait to see if it happened again.\n\nWell, we were going along fine and the other morning, April 5, she had\na bowl of another Kellog's frosted kind of cereal, Fruit Loops (I am\nembarrassed to admit that I even bought that junk but every once\nin a while...) So I pour it in her bowl and think \"Oh, oh, this is the\nsame kind of junk she was eating when she had that seizure.\"  Ten \nminutes later she had a full blown seizures. This was her first exposure\nto a sugar coated cereal since the last seizure.\n\nWhen I mentioned what she ate the first time as a possible reason for\nthe seizure the neurologist basically negated that as an idea.  Now\nafter this second episode, so similar in nature to the first, even\nhe is scratching his head.  Once again her EEG looks normal which I\nunderstand can happen even when a person has a seizure.\n\nOnce again we are waiting. I have been thinking that it would be good\nto get to as large a group as possible to see if anyone has any\nexperience with this kind of thing.  I know that members of the medical\ncommunity are sometimes loathe to admit the importance that diet and\nfoods play in our general health and well-being.  Anyway, as you can\nguess, I am worried sick about this, and would appreciate any ideas\nanyone out there has.

However it is also \nwidely acknowledged that perfectionism is inimicable to creativity. \nAnd in ordinary life, perfectionism carried beyond a certain point is \nindicative of a psychological disorder.  In the extreme case, a  \nperfectionist becomes so paralyzed by all the possible mistakes he might \nmake that he is unable to even leave the house.  \n\nIn science, we want to discover as much truth about the world as possible \nand we also want to have as much certainty as possible about these \ndiscoveries.  Usually there is some trade-off between these two desiderata \n--- the search for scope and the search for certainty.  \n\nIf 18th century mathematicians had demanded total rigor from Newton and \nLeibniz then there would probably be no calculus today, because neither \nof the two could explain calculus in a way that really made sense, since \nthey lacked the concept of a limit.  And in fact, because of the lack of \na rigorous foundation, they made a number of errors in their use of calculus. \nIt was only a hundred years later that Weistrass was able to give a solid \ngrounding for the ideas of Newton and Leibniz.  Nonetheless, what Newton \nand Leibniz did was undoubtedly science and mathematics gained a great \ndeal more from the application of their important ideas than it lost \nthrough the mistakes they made.  \n\nIn article <1993Apr14.171230.16138@kestrel.edu> king@reasoning.com \n    (Dick King) writes:\n>  [ Somebody writes: ]\n>>I doubt if Einstein used any formal methodology.  ....\n>  ....\n>He also proposed numerous experiments which if performed would distinguish a\n>universe in which special relativity holds from one in which it does not.\n>         ....\n>Einstein played by the rules, which demand that hypotheses only be put out\n>there if there exists a specific experiment that could disprove them.\n\nThese are not the rules according to many who post to sci.med and\nsci.psychology.  According to these posters  \"If it's not supported by\ncarefully designed controlled studies then it's not science.\"\n\nTaken to the extreme, I believe that the attitude that empirical studies \nare everything and ideas are nothing results in a complete stultification \nof science.  \n\nFor one thing, an insistence on an elaborate and expensive methodology \nresults in a sort of scientific trade-unionism, where those outside \nthe establishment and lacking institutional or corporate support have \nno chance to obtain a hearing.  (I don't in the least believe that this \nis the intention of the arbiters of scientific methodology.  Nonetheless, \nit is one of the results.)   And although institutional science has \ncertainly produced many wonderful results, I think it is a foolish \narrogance for scientists to believe that no one outside the establishment \n--- and using less than perfect empirical methodology --- will ever come \nwith anything worthwhile.  \n\nFurthermore, the big bucks approach to science promotes what I think is\none of the most significant errors in science:  choosing to investigate\nquestions because they can be readily handled by the currently\nfashionable methodology (or because one can readily get institutional\nor corporate sponsorship for them) instead of directing attention to\nthose questions which seem to have fundamental significance.\n\nFor instance, certain questions cannot be easily investigated with\nstatistical methods because the relevant factors are not quantitative.\n(One could argue that this is the case for almost all questions in many\nareas of psychology.  In my opinion, a perusal of many of the papers\nresulting from the attempt by psychologists to force these questions\ninto a statistical framework gives the lie to Russell Turpin's\nassertion that current scientific methods \"avoid all known errors.\")\n\nI think that asking the wrong question is probably the most fundamental \nerror in science.  (Ignoring potentially valuable ideas is one of the \nothers.)  And I think that scientific journals are full of all \ntoo many studies done with impeccable empirical methods but which are \nworthless because the wrong question was asked in the first place.  \n\n--\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \n\nlady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet\n"

Biomedical research doesn't make any basic \nassumptions that aren't the same as any other discipline of scientific\nresearch.  That is, that you make empirical observations, form an hypothesis\nand test it.  Modern medicine has much more to do with biochemistry than \n\"the old Newtonian model of the world\".  And I doubt that many psychologists\nwould appreciate being put outside this empirical \"world view\".

In the meantime, some folk will \nhave continued to believe in the spontaneous generation of animal life.  \nThere's nothing at all surprising about this, it's the way the gathering of\nknowledge works.  There are probably more than a few things in my own \ndiscipline of molecular biology that will be found to be totally off-base,\neven idiotic, to someone in the future.  These future people won't have come\nto these relevations because they had suddenly gone all Zen-like and had \na vision in an LSD trip.  Someone will have thought of something new and \ntested it.  This is the bit that people who seem to relish misrepresenting\nscience and research can't seem to wrap their minds around.  Science is a \ncreative process.  What I think of as factual and good research can be totally\nturned on its head tommorrow by new results and theories.  \n\nAgain, I think it gets down to defining what you mean by \"science\".  I often\ndon't recognize what it is that I do, and am involved in, in the way science\nis portrayed by popular media or writings of people in the humanities.  They\nportray science as a collection of immutable facts, pronouncements of TRUTH\nin big gold letters.  That's silly.  Its as though we just go into the lab,\nturn over a stone, and come up with a mechanism for transcriptional regula-\ntion.  Its much more interesting than that.

Our  \nthree year old daughter suffers from this disease.  Below is a press release  \nthat appeared in local newspapers.  Hope you can join us.\n\n\nOn Saturday, April 24 as part of Communiversity in Princeton, a local family  \nwill be having a bake and craft sale to raise money for and create public  \nawareness about a rare disease called Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis.\n\nBill and Marlene Stern's daughter Lindsay is afflicted with this disease  \ncharacterized by tumors attacking the inside of the larynx, vocal cords and  \ntrachea.  Caused by a virus, the tumors grow, block the air passages and would  \nlead to death from suffocation without continual surgery to remove the growths.   \nThree year old Lindsay has undergone 11 operations thus far since her diagnosis  \nlast year and faces the prospect of over a hundred operations throughout her  \nlifetime.  \n\nEven though the disease is hardly a household word, it has affected the lives  \nof enough people to inspire the formation of the Recurrent Respiratory  \nPapillomatosis Foundation,  a non-profit foundation whose goals are to provide  \nsupport for patients and families by networking patients and publishing a  \nnewsletter, enhance  awareness of RRP at the local and national level, and aid  \nin the prevention, cure, and treatment.\n\nSince medical researchers know that the virus causing the disease is similar to  \nthose viruses causing warts, they feel a cure would be within reach if money  \nwere available for research.  Because RRP is rare, it not only gets scant  \nattention but also paltry funds to search for a cure.  Part of the RRP  \nFoundation's mission is to change that. \n\nAnyone interested in contributing items to the bake and craft sale, please call  \nMarlene or Bill at 609-890-0502.  Monetary donations can be made at the  \nFoundation's booth during Communiversity, April 24th, 12 to 4 p.m., in downtown  \nPrinceton, or sent directly to:\n\n\t\t\tThe Recurrent Respiratory Foundation\n\t                50 Wesleyan Drive\n\t                Hamilton Sq., NJ  08690.\nThanks   mstern@lindsay.princeton.edu\n"

The OAM is a small division of \nthe NIH, with its budget only at $2  million dollars compared to more than $10 \nbillion for the NIH as  a whole.  In addition, the money for available \nresearch grants is even smaller.  About $500,000 to $600,000 total will be \navailable this year for 10 or 20 grants.  Kaiya Montaocean, of the Center  for \nNatural and Traditional Medicine in Washington, D.C., says  the OAM is afraid \nto become involved in AIDS.  \"They have to look successful and there is no \neasy answer in AIDS,\" she said.    There is also a common perception that the \nOAM will focus on  fields the NIH establishment will find non-threatening, \nsuch as  relaxation techniques and acupuncture.  When the OAM called for  an \nadvisory committee conference of about 120 people last year,  the AIDS \ncommunity was largely missing from the meeting.  In  addition, activists' \ngeneral lack of contact with the Office has  added suspicion that the epidemic \nwill be ignored.  Jon  Greenberg, of ACT-UP/New York, said, \"The OAM advisory \npanel is  composed of practitioners without real research experience.  It  \nwill take them several years to accept the nature of research.\"   \nNevertheless,  Dr. Leanna Standish, research director and AIDS  investigator \nat the Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine in  Seattle, said, \"Here is a \nwonderful opportunity to fund AIDS  research.  It's only fair to give the \nOffice time to gel, but  it's up to the public to insist that it's much, much \nmore [than  public relations].\" \n======================================================================   \n\"Herpesvirus Decimates Immune-cell Soldiers\" Science News (04/03/93) Vol. 143, \nNo. 14, P. 215   (Fackelmann, Kathy A.) \n\n     Scientists conducting test tube experiments have found that  herpesvirus-\n6 can attack the human immune system's natural killer cells.  This attack \ncauses the killer cells to malfunction,  diminishing an important component in \nthe immune system's fight  against diseases.  Also, the herpesvirus-6 may be a \nfactor in  immune diseases, such as AIDS.  In 1989, Paolo Lusso's research  \nfound that herpesvirus-6 attacks another white cell, the CD4  T-lymphocyte, \nwhich is the primary target of HIV.  Lusso also  found that herpesvirus-6 can \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 44\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nkill natural killer cells.   Scientists previously knew that the natural \nkiller cells of  patients infected with HIV do not work correctly.  Lusso's  \nresearch represents the first time scientists have indicated that natural \nkiller cells are vulnerable to any kind of viral attack,  according to Anthony \nL. Komaroff, a researcher with Harvard  Medical School.  Despite the test-tube \nfindings, scientists are  uncertain whether the same result occurs in the \nbody.  Lusso's  team also found that herpesvirus-6 produces the CD4 receptor  \nmolecule that provides access for HIV.  CD4 T-lymphocytes express this surface \nreceptor, making them vulnerable to HIV's attack.   Researchers concluded that \nherpesvirus-6 cells can exacerbate the affects of HIV. \n\n    ======================================================================   \n                                April 15, 1993 \n     ====================================================================   \n\n\"AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: To the Editor\" Journal of the \nAmerican Medical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Gellert, \nGeorge and Nordenberg, Dale F.) \n\n     All health-care workers are obligated and responsible for not  only \nensuring that politicians understand the dimensions of  certain health \nproblems, but also to be committed to related  policies, write George Gellert \nand Dale F. Nordenberg of the  Orange County Health Care Agency, Santa Ana, \nCalif., and the  Emory University School of Public Health in Atlanta, Ga.,  \nrespectively.  Dr. Berkley's editorial on why American doctors  should care \nabout the AIDS epidemic beyond the United States  details several reasons for \nthe concerted interest that all  countries share in combating AIDS.  It should \nbe noted that while AIDS leads in hastening global health interdependence, it \nis not  the only illness doing so.  Diseases such as malaria and many  \nrespiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economic \ndevelopment of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large populations.  \nBerkley mentions the enormous social and  economic impact that AIDS will have \non many developing countries, and the increased need for international \nassistance that will  result.  Berkley also cites the lack of political \naggressiveness  toward the AIDS epidemic in its first decade.  But now there \nis a new administration with a promise of substantial differences in  approach \nto international health and development in general, and  HIV/AIDS in \nparticular.  Vice President Al Gore proposes in his  book \"Earth in the \nBalance\" a major environmental initiative that includes sustainable \ninternational development, with programs to  promote literacy, improve child \nsurvival, and disseminate  contraceptive technology and access throughout the \ndeveloping  world.  If enacted, this change in policy could drastically  \nchange the future of worldwide health. \n====================================================================   \n\"AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: In Reply\" Journal of the American \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 45\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nMedical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Berkley, Seth) \n\n     Every nation should tackle HIV as early and aggressively as    possible \nbefore the disease reaches an endemic state, even at a  cost of diverting less \nattention to some other illnesses, writes  Seth Berkley of the Rockefeller \nFoundation in New York, N.Y., in  reply to a letter by Drs. Gellert and \nNordenberg.  Although it is true that diseases other than AIDS, such as \nmalaria and  respiratory and intestinal illnesses, have similarly inhibited  \neconomic development in developing countries and deserve much  more attention \nthan they are getting, Berkley disagrees with the  contention that AIDS is \nreceiving too much attention.  HIV  differs from other diseases, in most \ndeveloping countries because it is continuing to spread.  For most endemic \ndiseases, the  outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is another \nyear  of about the same level of needless disease and death.  But with  AIDS \nand its increasing spread, the cost of neglect, not only in  disease burden \nbut financially, is much greater.  Interventions  in the early part of a \nrampantly spreading epidemic like HIV are  highly cost-effective because each \nindividual infection prevented significantly interrupts transmission.  Berkley \nsays he agrees  with Gellert and Nordenberg about the gigantic social and  \neconomic effects of AIDS and about the need for political  leadership.  But he \nconcludes that not only is assertive  political leadership needed in the \nUnited States for the AIDS  epidemic, but even more so in developing countries \nwith high  rates of HIV infection and where complacency about the epidemic  \nhas been the rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 46\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n                               AIDS/HIV Articles\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n            First HIV Vaccine Trial Begins in HIV-Infected Children\n                                H H S   N E W S\n     ********************************************************************\n                 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES\n                                March 29, 1993\n\n\n        First HIV Vaccine Therapy Trial Begins In HIV-Infected Children\n\n\nThe National Institutes of Health has opened the first trial of experimental \nHIV vaccines in children who are infected with the human immunodeficiency \nvirus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS. \n\nThe trial will compare the safety of three HIV experimental vaccines in 90 \nchildren recruited from at least 12 sites nationwide. Volunteers must be HIV-\ninfected but have no symptoms of HIV disease. \n\nHHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala said this initial study can be seen as \"a \nhopeful milestone in our efforts to ameliorate the tragedy of HIV-infected \nchildren who now face the certainty they will develop AIDS.\" \n\nAnthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and \nInfectious Diseases and of the NIH Office of AIDS Research, said the trial \"is \nthe first step in finding out whether vaccines can help prevent or delay \ndisease progression in children with HIV who are not yet sick.\"  If these \nvaccines prove to be safe, more sophisticated questions about their \ntherapeutic potential will be assessed in Phase II trials. \n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 10,000 children in \nthe United States have HIV.  By the end of the decade, the World Health \nOrganization projects 10 million children will be infected worldwide. \n\nThe study will enroll children ages 1 month to 12 years old.  NIAID, which \nfunds the AIDS Clinical Trials Group network, anticipates conducting the trial \nat nine ACTG sites around  the country and three sites participating in the \nACTG but funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human \nDevelopment. \n\nPreliminary evidence from similar studies under way in infected adults shows \nthat certain vaccines can boost existing HIV-specific immune responses and \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 47\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nstimulate new ones.  It will be several years, however, before researchers \nknow how these responses affect the clinical course of the disease. \n\nThe results from the pediatric trial, known as ACTG 218, will be examined \nclosely for other reasons as well.  \"This trial will provide the first insight \ninto how the immature immune system responds to candidate HIV vaccines,\" said \nDaniel Hoth, M.D., director of NIAID's division of AIDS.  \"We need this \ninformation to design trials to test whether experimental vaccines can prevent \nHIV infection in children.\" \n\nIn the United States, most HIV-infected children live in poor inner-city \nareas, and more than 80 percent are minorities, mainly black or Hispanic. \n\nNearly all HIV-infected children acquire the virus from their mothers during \npregnancy  or at birth.  An infected mother in the United States has more than \na one in four chance of transmitting the virus to her baby.  As growing \nnumbers of women of childbearing age become exposed to HIV through injection \ndrug use or infected sexual partners, researchers expect a corresponding \nincrease in the numbers of infected children. \n\nHIV disease progresses more rapidly in infants and children than in adults.  \nThe most recent information suggests that 50 percent of infants born with HIV \ndevelop a serious AIDS-related infection by 3 to 6 years of age.  These \ninfections include severe or frequent bouts of common bacterial illnesses of \nchildhood that can result in seizures, pneumonia, diarrhea and other symptoms \nleading to nutritional problems and long hospital stays. \n\nAt least half of the children in the trial will be 2 years of age or younger \nto enable comparison of the immune responses of the younger and older \nparticipants.  All volunteers must have well-documented HIV infection but no \nsymptoms of HIV disease other than swollen lymph glands or a mildly swollen \nliver or spleen.  They cannot have received any anti-retroviral or immune-\nregulating drugs within one month prior to their entry into the study. \n\nStudy chair John S. Lambert, M.D., of the University of Rochester Medical \nSchool, and co- chair Samuel Katz, M.D., of Duke University School of \nMedicine, will coordinate the trial assisted by James McNamara, M.D., medical \nofficer in the pediatric medicine branch of NIAID's division of AIDS. \n\n\"We will compare the safety of the vaccines by closely monitoring the children \nfor any side effects, to see if one vaccine produces more swollen arms or \nfevers, for example, than another,\" said Dr. McNamara.  \"We'll also look at \nwhether low or high doses of the vaccines stimulate immune responses or other \nsignificant laboratory or clinical effects.\"   He emphasized that the small \nstudy size precludes comparing these responses or effects among the three \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 48\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nproducts. \n\nThe trial will test two doses each of three experimental vaccines made from \nrecombinant HIV proteins.  These so-called subunit vaccines, each genetically \nengineered to contain only a piece of the virus, have so far proved well-\ntolerated in ongoing trials in HIV-infected adults. \n\nOne vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Inc. of Meriden, Conn., contains gp160--a \nprotein  that gives rise to HIV's surface proteins--plus alum adjuvant.  \nAdjuvants boost specific immune responses to a vaccine.  Presently, alum is \nthe only adjuvant used in human vaccines licensed by the Food and Drug \nAdministration. \n\nBoth of the other vaccines--one made by Genentech Inc. of South San Francisco \nand the other by Biocine, a joint venture of Chiron and CIBA-Geigy, in \nEmeryville, Calif.--contain the major HIV surface protein, gp120, plus \nadjuvant.  The Genentech vaccine contains alum, while the Biocine vaccine \ncontains MF59, an experimental adjuvant that has proved safe and effective in \nother Phase I vaccine trials in adults. \n\nA low dose of each product will be tested first against a placebo in 15 \nchildren.  Twelve children will be assigned at random to be immunized with the \nexperimental vaccine, and three children will be given adjuvant alone, \nconsidered the placebo.  Neither the health care workers nor the children will \nbe told what they receive. \n\nIf the low dose is well-tolerated, controlled testing of a higher dose of the \nexperimental vaccine and adjuvant placebo in another group of 15 children will \nbegin. \n\nEach child will receive six immunizations--one every four weeks for six \nmonths--and be followed-up for 24 weeks after the last immunization.  \n\nFor more information about the trial sites or eligibility for enrollment, call \nthe AIDS Clinical Trials Information Service, 1-800-TRIALS-A, from 9 a.m. to 7 \np.m., EST weekdays.

Although the \nHIV genes were active in the mice, they did not compromise the animals' \nimmunity, the researchers found.  This led them to conclude that the HIV \nitself caused the skin disease. \n\nOur findings support a growing body of evidence that HIV can cause disease \nwithout affecting the immune system, said lead author Dr. Jeffrey Kopp of the \nNational Institute of Dental Research (NIDR).  Dr. Kopp and his colleagues \ndescribed their study in the March issue of AIDS Research and Human \nRetroviruses. \n\nDeveloping animal models of HIV infection has been difficult, since most \nanimals, including mice, cannot be infected by the virus.  To bypass this \nproblem, scientists have developed HIV-transgenic mice, which carry genes for \nHIV as well as their own genetic material. \n\nNIDR scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting HIV genes into mouse \neggs and then implanting the eggs into female mice.  The resulting litters \ncontained both normal and transgenic animals. \n\nInstitute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of HIV \ngenetic material in l988.  Those mice, however, became sick and died too soon \nafter birth to study in depth.  In the present study, the scientists used an \nincomplete copy of HIV, which allowed the animals to live longer. \n\nSome of the transgenic animals developed scaling, wart-like tumors on their \nnecks and backs.  Other transgenic mice developed thickened, crusting skin \nlesions that covered most of their bodies, resembling psoriasis in humans.  No \nskin lesions developed in their normal, non-transgenic littermates. \n\nStudies of tissue taken from the wart-like skin tumors showed that they were a \ntype of noncancerous tumor called papilloma. Although the papillomavirus can \ncause these skin lesions, laboratory tests showed no sign of that virus in the \nanimals. \n\nTissue samples taken from the sick mice throughout the study revealed the \npresence of a protein-producing molecule made by the HIV genetic material.  \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 50\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nEvidence of HIV protein production proved that the viral genes were \"turned \non,\" or active, said Dr. Kopp. \n\nThe scientists found no evidence, however, of compromised immunity in the \nmice:  no increase in their white blood cell count and no signs of common \ninfections.  The fact that HIV genes were active but the animals' immune \nsystems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing the \nskin lesions, Dr. Kopp said. \n\nFurther proof of HIV gene involvement came from a test in which the scientists \nexposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet light.  The light increased HIV \ngenetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy skin.  \nPapilloma formation in response to increased HIV genetic activity proved the \ngenes were responsible for the skin condition, the scientists said.  No \nlesions appeared on normal mice exposed to the UV light. \n\nThe transgenic mice used in this study were developed at NIDR by Dr. Peter \nDickie, who is now with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious \nDiseases. \n\nCollaborating on the study with Dr. Kopp were Mr. Charles Wohlenberg, Drs. \nNickolas Dorfman, Joseph Bryant, Abner Notkins, and Paul Klotman, all of NIDR; \nDr. Stephen Katz of the National Cancer Institute; and Dr. James Rooney, \nformerly with NIDR and now with Burroughs Wellcome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 51\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n               Clinical Consultation Telephone Service for AIDS\n                                H H S   N E W S\n                 ********************************************\n                 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES\n\n                                 March 4, 1993\n\n\n     HHS Secretary Donna E.

A second goal is to get more primary health \ncare providers involved in care for people with HIV or AIDS, which reduces \ntreatment cost by allowing patients to remain with their medical providers and \ncommunity social support networks.  Currently, many providers refer patients \nwith HIV or AIDS to specialists or other providers who have more experience.\" \n     Secretary Shalala said, \"This clinical expertise should be especially \nhelpful for physicians and providers who treat people with HIV or AIDS in \ncommunities and clinical sites where HIV expertise is not readily available.\" \n     The telephone number for health care professionals is 1-800-933-3413, and \nit is accessible from 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. EST (7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. PST) \nMonday through Friday.  During these times, consultants will try to answer \nquestions immediately, or within an hour.  At other times, physicians and \nhealth care providers can leave an electronic message, and questions will be \nanswered as quickly as possible. \n     Health care professionals may call the service to ask any question \nrelated to providing HIV care, including the latest HIV/AIDS drug treatment \ninformation, clinical trials information, subspecialty case referral, \nliterature searches and other information.  The service is designed for health \ncare professionals rather than patients, families or others who have alternate \nsources of information or materials. \n     When a health care professional calls the new service, the call is taken \nby either a clinical pharmacist, primary care physician or family nurse \npractitioner.  All staff members have extensive experience in outpatient and \ninpatient primary care for people with HIV-related diseases.  The consultant \nasks for patient-specific information, including CD4 cell count, current \nmedications, sex, age and the patient's HIV history. \n     This national service has grown out of a 16-month local effort that \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 52\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nresponded to nearly 1,000 calls from health care providers in northern \nCalifornia.  The initial project was funded by HRSA's Bureau of Health \nProfessions, through its Community Provider AIDS Training (CPAT) project, and \nby the American Academy of Family Physicians. \n     \"When providers expand their knowledge, they also improve the quality of \ncare they are able to provide to their patients,\" said HRSA Administrator \nRobert G. Harmon. M.D., M.P.H.  \"This project will be a great resource for \nhealth care professionals and the HIV/AIDS patients they serve.\" \n     \"This service has opened a new means of communication between health care \nprofessionals and experts on HIV care management,\" said HRSA's associate \nadministrator for AIDS and director of the Bureau of Health Resources \nDevelopment, G. Stephen Bowen, M.D., M.P.H.  \"Providers who treat people with \nHIV or AIDS have access to the latest information on new drugs, treatment \nmethods and therapies for people with HIV or AIDS.\" \n     HRSA is one of eight U.S. Public Health Service agencies within HHS.  \n\n\n                      AIDS Hotline Numbers for Consumers\n\n                  CDC National AIDS Hotline -- 1-800-342-AIDS\n                  for information in Spanish - 1-800-344-SIDA\n          AIDS Clinical Trials (English & Spanish) -- 1-800-TRIALS-A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 53\n\n------------- cut here -----------------\n-- This is the last part ---------------\n\n---\n      Internet: david@stat.com                  FAX: +1 (602) 451-1165\n      Bitnet: ATW1H@ASUACAD                     FidoNet=> 1:114/15\n                Amateur Packet ax25: wb7tpy@wb7tpy.az.usa.na\n"

If it\nchanges anything. \n\nYou can live on the diet but you need to up your calories. Where before you\nhad a pat of butter now you need a medium apple (probably microwave\ncooked).  Smaller meals but more of them. Not terrific amounts of meat, it's\nhard to digest anyway. \n\nFor comfort and to make the carbohydrate meal \"last\" longer eat pasta or\nrice which give their calories up slowly rather than bread or corn. Maybe\nsmaller meals as you may be getting less room in the stomach area. Is the\nbaby still coming up. Is it starting to push or rub under your ribs? How\ntight are your clothes. You shouldn't be wearing any clothing that compresses \nyour middle. Be sure not to \"suck in\" your stomach when sitting, again it\nwill put pressure on the digestive tract. \n\nTry laying on your sides, back,\nand stay in reclining positions for the many hours you are being inactive.\nEasier on your legs (circulation) as well. You might try letting the baby\n\"turn\" or at least not be forced under the ribs during the last months.\nWhen you are shortwaisted it's easy for that baby to end up right under the\ndiaphram, especially if you have tight abdominal muscles. If I had my\nsecond one to do over again I think I'd have tried to loosen up since he\ndidn't turn sideways until late and the relief was enormous.\n\n\nMaybe this doctor does have a thing about weight gain in pregnancy or maybe\nshe just nags all her patients this way. Especially if she's young. \nBut this gallbladder/whatever problem that might be coming up is something\nto be avoided if possible. \n\nNausea, etc. can vary from person to person and with each pregnancy. My\nfirst pregnancy was miserable. During the second I had very little trouble.\nSome articles have said that women with nausea had a statistically better\nchance of carrying their baby.

It is more than 99 percent \neffective.\n\n\"This drug presents another long-term, effective option for women to prevent \npregnancy,\" said FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler, M.D. \"As an injectable, \ngiven once every three months, Depo Provera eliminates problems related to \nmissing a daily dose.\"\n\nDepo Provera is available in 150 mg. single dose vials from doctors and \nclinics and must be given on a regular basis to maintain contraceptive \nprotection. If a patient decides to become pregnant, she discontinues the \ninjections.\n\nAs with any such products, FDA advises patients to discuss the benefits and \nrisks of Depo Provera with their doctor or other health care professional \nbefore making a decision to use it.\n\nDepo Provera's effectiveness as a contraceptive was established in extensive \nstudies by the manufacturer, the World Health Organization and health agencies \nin other countries. U.S. clinical trials, begun in 1963, also found Depo \nProvera effective as an injectable contraceptive.\n\nThe most common side effects are menstrual irregularities and weight gain. In \naddition, some patients may experience headache, nervousness, abdominal pain, \ndizziness, weakness or fatigue. The drug should not be used in women who have \nacute liver disease, unexplained vaginal bleeding, breast cancer or blood \nclots in the legs, lungs or eyes.\n\nThe labeling advises doctors to rule out pregnancy before prescribing the \ndrug, due to concerns about low birth weight in babies exposed to the drug. \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 14\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nRecent data have also demonstrated that long-term use may contribute to \nosteoporosis.

The UpJohn Company of Kalamazoo, Mich., \nwhich will market the drug under the name, Depo Provera Contraceptive \nInjection, first submitted it for approval in the United States in the 1970s. \nAt that time, animal studies raised questions about its potential to cause \nbreast cancer.

Sullivan, M.D. \"The effort \nto accelerate FDA review for these drugs has been a long-term commitment and \nindeed a hallmark of this administration.\" \n\nThese rules establish procedures for the Food and Drug Administration to \napprove a drug based on \"surrogate endpoints\" or markers. They apply when the \ndrug provides a meaningful benefit over currently available therapies. Such \nendpoints would include laboratory tests or physical signs that do not in \nthemselves constitute a clinical effect but that are judged by qualified \nscientists to be likely to correspond to real benefits to the patient. \n\nUse of surrogate endpoints for measurement of drug efficacy permits approval \nearlier than if traditional endpoints -- such as relief of disease symptoms or \nprevention of disability and death from the disease -- are used. \n\nThe new rules provide for therapies to be approved as soon as safety and \neffectiveness, based on surrogate endpoints, can be reasonably established. \nThe drug's sponsor will be required to agree to continue or conduct \npostmarketing human studies to confirm that the drug's effect on the surrogate \nendpoint is an indicator of its clinical effectiveness. \n\nOne new drug -- zalcitabine (also called ddC) -- was approved June 19, using a \nmodel of this process, for treating the human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, the \ncause of AIDS. \n\nAccelerated approval can also be used, if necessary, when FDA determines that \na drug, judged to be effective for the treatment of a disease, can be used \nsafely only under a restricted distribution plan. \n\n\"The new rules will help streamline the drug development and review process \nwithout sacrificing goad science and rigorous FDA oversight,\" said FDA \ncommissioner David A.

[NASDAQ: REGN] have discovered that \ncertain naturally occurring substances known as neurotrophic factors can \nprevent the degeneration of light-sensing cells in the retina of the eye. The \ndegeneration of these cells, known as photoreceptors, is a major cause of \nvisual impairment \n     This research, published to in the December issue of the Proceedings of \nthe National Academy of Science (PNAS), holds promise for people who may lose \ntheir sight due to progressive retinal degeneration -- currently, no drug \ntreatment for retinal degeneration exists. It is estimated that 2.5 million \nAmericans have severe vision loss due to age-related macular degeneration and \n100,000 Americans are affected by retinitis pigmentosus, a hereditary disease \nthat causes blindness. In addition, each year more than 15,000 people undergo \nsurgical procedures to repair retinal detachments and other retinal traumas. \n     The research was funded in part by the RP (Retinitis Pigmentosa) \nFoundation Fighting Blindness, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and the National Eye \nInstitute. It was conducted by Drs. Matthew M. LaVail, Kazuhiko Unoki, Douglas \nYasurnura, Michael T. Matthes and Roy H. Steinberg at UCSF, arld Dr. C;eorge \nYancoooulos, Regeneron's Vice President for Discovery. Regeneron holds an \nexclusive license for this research from UCSF.\n     In the research described in the PNAS , a light-damage model was used to \nassess the survival-promoting activity of a number of naturally occurring \nsubstances. Experimental rats were exposed to constant light for one week. \nEyes that had not been treated with an effective factor lost most of their \nphotoreceptor cells -- the rods and cones of the retina -- after light \nexposure. Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and Ciliary Neurotrophic \nFactor (CNTF) were particularly effective in this model without causing \nunwanted side effects; other factors such as Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and \nInsulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-1) were not effective in these experiments. \n     Discussing the research, Dr. Jesse M. Cedarbaum, Regeneron's Director of \nClinical Research, said, \"BDNF's ability to rescue neurons in the retina that \nhave been damaged by light exposure may hold promise for the treatment of age-\nrelated macular degeneration, one of the leading causes of vision impairment, \nand for retinal detachment. Following detachment, permanent vision loss may \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nresult frorn the death of detached retinal cells. It is possible that BDNF \ncould play a role in rescuing those cells once the retina has been reattached \nsurgically.\" \n     \"Retinitis pigmentosa is a slowly progressing disease that causes the \nretina to degenerate over a period of years or even decades. Vision decreases \nto a small tunnel of sight and can result in total blindness. It is our hope \nthat research on growth factors will provide a means to slow the progression \nand preserve useful vision throughout life,\" stated Jeanette S. Felix, Ph.D., \nDirector of Science for the RP Foundation Fighting Blindness. \n     In addition to the work described , Regeneron is developing BDNF in \nconjunction with Aingen Inc. [NASDAQ:AMGN] as a possible treatment for \nperipheral neuropathies associated with diabetes and cancer chemotherapy, \nmotor neuron diseases, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. By \nitself, Regeneron is testing CNTF in patients with arnyotrophic lateral \nsclerosis (commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease). \n     Regeneron Pharlnaceuticals, Inc., based in Tarrytown, New York, is a \nleader in the discovery and development of biotechnology-based compounds for \nthe treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, peripheral neuropathies and nerve \ninjuries, which affect more than seven million Americans. Drs. LaVail and \nSteinberg of UCSF are consultants to Regeneron.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 19\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\n                 Affluent Diet Increases Risk Of Heart Disease\n\n                          Research Resources Reporter\n                           written by Mary Weideman\n                                 Nov/Dec 1992\n                         National Institutes of Health\n\n\n     High-fat, high-calorie diets rapidly increase risk factors for coronary \nheart disease in native populations of developing countries that have \ntraditionally consumed diets low in fat.  These findings, according to \ninvestigators at the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland, have \nserious implications for public health in both industrialized and developing \ncountries. \n     \"This study demonstrates why we can develop coronary heart disease and \nhave higher blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels.  It shows also the \nimportance of diet and particularly the potential of the diet to increase body \nweight, thereby leading to a whole host of other health problems in developing \ncountries and affluent nations as well,\" explains principal investigator Dr. \nWilliam E. Connor, head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid \nmetabolism at Oregon Health Sciences University. \n     Over the past 25 years Dr. Connor and his team have characterized the \nfood and nutrient intakes of the Tara humara Indians in Mexico, while \nsimultaneously documenting various aspects of Tarahumara lipid metabolism.  \nThese native Mexicans number approximately 50,000 and reside in the Sierra \nMadre Occidental Mountains in the state of Chihuahua.  The Tarahumaras have \ncoupled an agrarian diet to endurance racing.  Probably as a result, coronary \nheart disease, which is so prevalent in Western industrialized nations, is \nvirtually non existent in their culture.  Loosely translated, the name \nTarahumara means \"fleet of foot,\" reflecting a tribal passion for betting on \n\"kickball\" races, in which participants run distances of 100 miles or more \nwhile kicking a machete-carved wooden ball.\n     The typical Tarahumara diet consists primarily of pinto beans, tortillas, \nand pinole, a drink made of ground roasted corn mixed with cold water, \ntogether with squash and gath ered fruits and vegetables.  The Tara humaras \nalso eat small amounts of game, fish, and eggs.  Their food contains \napproximately 12 percent of total calories as fat of which the majority (69 \npercent) is of vegetable origin.  Dietician Martha McMurry, a coinvestigator \nin the study, describes their diet as simple and very rich in nutrients while \nlow in cholesterol and fat.\n     The Tarahumaras have average plasma cholesterol levels of 121 mg/ dL, \nlow-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels of 72 mg/dl, and high-density \nlipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels of 32 to 42 mg/dl.  All of those values \nare in the good, low-risk range, according to the researchers.  Elevated \ncholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels are considered risk factors for heart \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 20\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\ndisease.  HDL-cholesterol is considered beneficial.  In previous studies the \nTarahumaras had been found to be at low risk for cardiac disease, although \nable to respond to high-cholesterol diets with elevations in total and LDL-\ncholesterol. \n     Clinical Research Center dietitian McMurry and coinvestigator Maria \nTeresa Cerqueira established a metabolic unit in a Jesuit mission school \nbuilding near a community hospital in the small village of Sisoguichi.  Food \nwas weighed, cooked, and fed to the study participants under the \ninvestigators' direct supervision, ensuring that subjects ate only food \nstipulated by the research protocol.  Fasting blood was drawn twice weekly, \nand plasma samples were frozen and shipped to Dr. Connors laboratory for \ncholesterol, triglyceride, and lipoprotein analyses.  Regular measurements \nincluded participant body weight, height, and triceps skin fold thickness.  \nThirteen Tarahumaras, five women and eight men, including one adolescent, were \nfed their native diet for 1 week, followed by 5 weeks of an \"affluent\" diet. \n     \"In this study we went up to a concentration of dietary fat that was 40 \npercent of total calories.  This is the prototype of the holiday diet that \nmany Americans consume a diet high in fat, sugar, and cholesterol, low in \nfiber,\" elaborates Dr. Conners. Such dietary characteristics are reflected in \nthe cholesterol-saturation index, or CSI, recently devised research dietitian \nSonja Conner working with Dr. Connor.  \"The CSI is a single number that \nincorporates both the amount of cholesterol and the amount of saturated fat in \nthe diet.  CSI indicates the diet's potential to elevate the cholesterol \nlevel, particularly the LDL,\" Dr. Connor explains.  The Tarahumaran diet \naverages a very low CSI of 20; Dr. Connor's \"affluent\" diet used in the study \nranks a CSI of 149. \n     The experimental design of this study reflects the importance of \nestablishing baseline plasma lipid levels, typical of the native diet, before \nexposing subjects to the experimental diet.  The standard curve relating \ndietary food intake to plasma cholesterol demonstrates a leveling off, or \nplateau, for consumption of large amounts of fat.  Changes in dietary fat \nand/or cholesterol in this range have little effect on plasma levels.  \"You \nmust have the baseline diet almost free of the variables you are going to put \ninto the experimental diet.  The Framingham study, for example, did not \ndiscriminate on the basis of diet between individuals who got heart disease \nbecause the diet was already high in fat.  All subjects were already eating on \na plateau,\" Dr. Connor says. \n     After 5 weeks of consuming the \"affluent\" diet, the subjects' mean plasma \ncholesterol levels had in creased by 31 percent, primarily in the LDL \nfraction, which rose 39 percent.  HDL-cholesterol increased by 31 per cent, \nand LDL to HDL ratios changed therefore very little.  Plasma triglyceride \nlevels increased by 18 percent, and subjects averaged an 8-pound gain in \nweight.  According to Dr. Connor, lipid changes occurred surprisingly soon, \nyielding nearly the same results after 7 days of affluent diet as after 35 \ndays. \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 21\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\n     The increase in HDL carries broad dietary implications for industrialized \nnations.  \"We think HDL-cholesterol increased because we increased the amount \nof dietary fat over the fat content used in the previous Tarahumara metabolic \nstudy.  In that study we saw no change in HDL levels after raising the dietary \ncholesterol but keeping the fat relatively consistent with native consumption.  \nIn the present study we increased fat intake to 40 percent of the total \ncalories.  We reached the conclusion in the Tarahumara study that HDL reflects \nthe amount of dietary fat in general and not the amount of dietary \ncholesterol.  HDL must increase to help metabolize the fat, and it increased \nquite a bit in this study,\" Dr. Connor explains.\n     Low HDL in the Tarahumarans is not typically an important predictor of \ncoronary heart disease because they do not normally consume large amounts of \nfat or cholesterol.  HDL remains an important predictor to Americans because \nof their usual high fat intake. \n     Dr. Connor recommends a diet for Americans that contains less than 20 \npercent of total calories as fat, less than 100 mg of cholesterol, and a CSI \naround 20, varying in accordance with caloric needs.  Such a diet is low in \nmeat and dairy fat, high in fiber.  Dr. Connor also comments on recent \nsuggestions that Americans adopt a \"Mediterranean-style\" diet.  \"The original \nMediterranean diet, in its pristine state, consisted of a very low intake of \nfat and very few animal and dairy products.  We are already eating a lot of \nmeat and dairy products.  Simply to continue that pattern while switching to \nolive oil is not going to help the situation.\" \n     The World Health Organization (WHO) is focusing much attention on the \nemergence of diseases such as coronary heart disease in nations and societies \nundergoing technological development.  Dr. Connor says that coronary heart \ndisease starts with a given society's elite, who typically eat a different \ndiet than the average citizen.  \"If the pattern of afluence increases, the \nentire population will have have a higher incidence of coronary heart disease, \nwhich places a termendous health care burden on a society.  WHO would like the \ndeveloping countries to prevent coronary heart disease, so they can \nconcentrate on other aspects of their economic development and on public \nhealth measures to improve general well-being, rather than paying for \nunnecessary, expensive medical technology,\" Dr. Connors says.\n     \"The overall implication of this study is that humans can readily move \ntheir plasma lipids and lipoprotein values into a high-risk range within a \nvery short time by an affluent, excessive diet.  The present rate of coronary \nheart disease in the United States is 30 percent less than it was 20 years \nago, so a lot has been accomplished.  We are changing rapidly,\" he concludes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 22\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\n\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n                             General Announcments\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n        Publications for Health Professionals Available from NCI (1/93)\n\nUnless otherwise noted, the following materials are provided free of charge by \ncalling the NCI's Publication Ordering Service, 1-800-4-CANCER.

All the clamor \nover laetril resulted in the NCI spending quite a bit of money on clinical \ntrials which proved(to me anyway) that laetril was ineffective against \ncancer.  A physician who continued to use it, when better, more effective, \ntreatments are available, may deserve to be called a quack.  Anti-fungals \nare in a different class.  The big question seems to be is it reasonable to \nuse them in patients with GI distress or sinus problems that *could* be due \nto candida blooms following the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics?  Gorden \nRubenfeld, through e-mail, has assured me that most physicians recognize \nthe chance of candida blooms occuring after broad-spectrum antibiotic use \nand they therefore reinnoculate their patients with *good* bacteria to \nrestore competetion for candida in the body.  I do not believe that this is \nyet a standard part of medical practice.  He deals with critical care \npatients where fungal infection(systemic) is a real problem and just \nbecause he tries to keep *good* bacteria in his patients does not mean that \nall physicians do this.  I think that aspergillis is more likely to be \nfound in the sinus mucus membranes than is candida.  Women have been known \nfor a very long time to suffer from candida blooms in the vagina and a \nwomen is lucky to find a physician who is willing to treat the cause and \nnot give give her advise to use the OTC anti-fungal creams.  Since candida \ncolonizes primarily in the ano-rectal area, GI symptoms should be more common \nthan vaginal problems after broad-spectrum antibiotic use.\n\nThe problem we have here David is proof that GI discomfort can be caused by \na candida bloom.  The arguement is that without proof, no action is \nwarrented.\n\nMedicine has not, and probalby never will be, practiced this way.  There \nhas always been the use of conventional wisdom.  A very good example is \nkidney stones.  Conventional wisdom(because clinical trails have not been \ndone to come up with an effective prevention), was that restricitng the \nintake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones \nfrom forming.  Clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to \nbreakdown the stone once it formed.  Through the recent New England J of \nMedicine article, we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong, \nincreasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is \nrestricting calcium intake.\n\nThe conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to \nbe reinnoculated with *good* bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapy.\nIf it makes sense for livestock, why doesn't it make sense for humans \nDavid?  We are not talking about a dangerous treatment(unless you consider \nyogurt dangerous).  If this were a standard part of medical practice, as \nGordon R. says it is, then the incidence of GI distress and vaginal yeast \ninfections should decline.\n\nMarty B.\n"

Gordon Rubenfeld did a Medline \nsearch and also sent me the same reference through e-mail.  Since \ncommercial yogurt does not always have a good Lactobacillus a. or \nbulgaricus culture, a negative finding would not have been too informative.\nThis is often the reason why Lactobacillus acidophilus tablets are \nrecommended rather than yogurt.\n\nI guess the next question is why would this introduction of \"good\" bacteria \nback into the gut decrease the incidence of vaginal candida blooms if the \nanus was not serving as a candida reservoir(a fact that Gordon R. vehementy\ndenys)?  I see two possible theories.  One, the L. acidophilus, which is a \nfacultatively anaerobic bacterium, could make it through the gut and \ncolonize the rectal area to overgrow the candida.  This would not explain \nthe reoccurance of candida blooms in the vagina after the yogurt ingestion \nwas stopped though.  The other is that the additional bacteria in the \nintestinal tract remove most of the glucose from the feces and candida \nlooses it's major food source.\n\nGetting Lactobacillus acidophilus to colonize the vaginal tract(where it is \nnormally found) would have a much better effect on the recurrance of vaginal \nyeast blooms though.  An acetic acid, Lactobacillus acidophilus douche has \nbeen used to get this effect but I've not seen any such treatment reported in \nthe medical literature.  This would be an example of physicians conducting \ntheir own clinical trials to try to come up with treatments that help their \npatients.  When this is done in private practice, the results are rarely, if \never published.  It was the hallmark of medicine until the modern age \nemerged with clinical trials.  It really raises a big question.  Does the \nmedical profession cast out the adventerous few who try new treatments to \nhelp patients or does it look the other way.\n\nThis particular issue is really a very simple one since no real dangerous \ntherapy is involved(even the anti-fungals are not all that dangerous).  But \nthere are some areas(like EDTA chelation therapy), where the fire is pretty \nhot and somebody could get burned.  It's really tough.  Do I follow only \nwell established protocols and then give up if they don't work that well or \ndo it try something that looks like it will work but hasn't been proven to \nwork yet?\n\nMy stand is to consider other treatment possibilities, especially if they \ninvolve little or no risk to the patient.  Getting good bacteria back into \nthe gut after antibiotic treatment is one treatment possibility.  The other \nis getting L. acidophilus into the vaginal tract of a woman who is having a \nproblem with recurring yeast infections.\n\nMarty B.\n"

There \nwill be an appendix with 100 - 200 more scientists with one paragraph\nbiographies who didn't quite make it to the double spreads. The whole thing\nwill then be published on CD-ROM with video and sound clips for added\nrichness. I am looking for a CD-ROM publisher as well.

Both my wife and I suffered from \nbouts of depression.  Her's was brought on by breast cancer and mine was a \nrebound stress reaction to her modified radical mastectomy and \nchemotherapy.  Lida, I used my knowledge of nutrition to get her through \nher six months of chemotherapy(with the approval of her oncologist).  When \nsevere depression set in a few months after the chemo stopped, I tried to \nuse supplements to bring her out of it.  I had \"cured\" her PMS using \nsupplements and I really thought that I knew enough about the role of diet \nin depression to take care of her depression as well.  It didn't work and \nshe was put on Prozac by her oncologist.  Two Winters ago(three years after \nby wife's breast cancer) I got hit with severe depression(pretty typical and \none reason why many marriages break up after breast cancer or another \nstressor).  I tried to take care of it for several months with \nsupplementation.  Didn't work.  My internist ended up putting me on Prozac. \nI was going to give you a list of several studies that have been done using \nB6, niacin, folate and B12 to \"cure\" depression.  I'm not going to do that \nbecause all you would be doing is flying blind like I was.\n\nLida, I do believe that depression can have a dietary component.  But the \nproblem is that you need to know exactly what the problem is and then use \nan approach which will \"fix\" the problem.  For chemotherapy, I knew exactly \nwhat drugs were going to be used and exactly what nutrients would be \naffected.  Same thing for PMS.  I was flying blind for both of these \nstressors but the literature that I used to devise a treatment program was \npretty good.  Depression is just too complicated.  What you really need is \na nutritional scan.  This is not a diet analysis but an analysis of your \nbodies nutrient reserves.  For every vitamin and mineral(except vitamin C), \nyou have a reserve.  The RDA is not designed to give you enough of any \nnutrient to keep these reserves full, it is only designed to keep them from \nbeing emptied which would cause clinical pathology.  Stress will increase \nyour need for many vitamins and minerals.  This is when your reserves become \nvery important.\n\nLida, without your permission, I'm going to use your post as a conduit to \ntry to explain to the readers in this group and Sci. Med. where I'm coming \nfrom.  I have taught a course on human nutrition in one of the Osteopathic \nMedical schools for ten years now.  I've written my own textbook because \nnone was available.  What I teach is not a rehash of biochemistry.  I \npreach nutrient reserves(yes my lectures in this course are referred to by \nmy students as sermons).  Here is what I cover:\n\nIndroduction and Carbohydrates \t\t\tLipids\n\nProteins I\t\t\t\t\tProteins II\n\nEnergy Balance\t\t\t\t\tEvaluation of Nutritional\n\t\t\t\t\t\tStatus I, A Clinical \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPerspective\n\nEvaluation of Nutritional Status II,            Evaluation of Nutritional\t\t\nA Biochemical Perspective\t\t\tStatus III, Homework \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAssignment Using the \n\t\t\t\t\t\tNutritionist IV Diet and \n\t\t\t\t\t\tFitness Analysis Software \n\t\t\t\t\t\tprogram\n\nWeight Control\t\t\t\t\tFood Fads and Facts\n\nAge-Related Change in Nutrient Requirements\tFood Additives, \n\t\t\t\t\t\tContaminants and Cancer\n\nDrug-Nutrient Interactions\t\t\tMineral and Water Balance\n\nSodium, Potassium and Chloride\t\t\tCalcium, Magnesium and \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPhosphorus\n\nIron\t\t\t\t\t\tZinc and Copper\n\nIodine and Fluoride\t\t\t\tOther Trace Minerals\n\nVitamin A\t\t\t\t\tVitamin E\n\nVitamins D and K\t\t\t\tVitamin C\n\nThiamin and Niacin\t\t\t\tRiboflavin and Pyridoxine\n\nPantothenic and Folic acids\t\t\tBiotin and B12\n\nOther Nutrient Factors\t\t\t\tEnteral Nutrition\n\nParenteral Nutrition\n\nEvery three years I spend my entire Summer reviewing the Medical literature \nto find material that I can use in my nutrition textbook.  I last did this \nin the Summer of 1991.  I read everything that I can find and then sit down \nand rewrite my lecture handouts which are bound in three separate books \nthat have 217, 237 and 122 pages.  Opposite each page of written text(which \nI write myself) I've pulled figures, tables and graphs from various \ncopyrighted sources.  Since this material is only being used for \neducational purposes, I can get around the copyright laws (so far).  I can not \nsend this material out to newsgroup readers(as I've been asked to do).\n\nI am now in the process of trying to get a grant to setup a nutrition \nassessment lab.  This is the last peice of the nutrition puzzle that I need \nto make my education program complete.  This lab will let me measure the \nnutrient reserve for almost all the vitamins and minerals that are known to \nbe required in humans.  The Mayo clinic already uses a similiar lab to \ndesign supplement programs for their cancer patients.  Cancer Treatment \nCenters of America, which is a private for-profit organization with \nhospitals in Illinois and Oklahoma(Tulsa) also operates a \nnutritional assessment clinical lab.  I also believe that the Pritikin \nClinic in California has a similiar lab setup.\n\nFor physicians reading this post, I would suggest that you get the new \nClinical Nutrition Textbook that has just been published(Feb) by Mosby.  I \nhave been using Alpers Manual of Nutritional Therapeutics(a Little Brown \nseries book) as a supplemental text for my course but Alpers is geared more \nto residency training.  Two M.D's have written this new Clinical Nutrition\ntextbook and it is geared more towards medical student education and it \ndoes a good job of covering the lab tests that can be run to assess a \npatient's nutritional status.  Let me quote a few sentences from the \nPreface of this new text:\n\n\"So-called nutrition specialists were in reality gastroenterologists, \nhematologists, or pediatricians who just happened to profess some knowledge \nof nutrition as it related to their field of practice.\"  \n\n\"Unfortunately, about two thirds of the medical schools in the United \nStates require no formal instruction in nutrition.\"\n\n\"But times and medical practice have changed.  More than half of the \nleading causes of death in this country are nutrition related.\"\n\n\"... this monograph should accomplish the following two objectives: (1) it \nshould complement your medical training by emphasizing the relevance of \nnutrition to your medical practice; and (2) it should heighten your \nawareness of nutrition as a medical speciality that is vitally important \nfor both disease prevention and the treatment of diseases of essentially \nevery organ system.\"\n\nRoland L. Weinsier, MD, DrPH \n\nLida, my advise to you is that you tell your family members to try to find \na physician who has an understanding of the role that vitamins and minerals\n(yes even magnesium may play a role in depression) play in depression and \nwho could get a nutritional profile run.  Menopause is often a time when \nwomen suffer depression.  There are a lot of hormonal changes that are \noccuring but they are not the same ones that occur during PMS.  A \nnutritionist may also be able to help.  Not too long ago a poster mentioned \nthat his nutritionist had diagnosed a selenium deficiency based on a red \ncell glutathionine peroxidase test(the specific test for the selenium \nreserve).  Most clinical labs will not run this test and I advised him to \ntry to make sure that the lab that did the test was certified.  There are \nalso a lot of hair and nail analysis labs setup to do trace mineral \nanalysis but these labs are not regulated.  Checks of these labs using \ncertified standards, and also those doing water lead analysis, showed some \npretty shoddy testing was going on.  If you or anyone else finds someone \nwho will run these speciality nutrition tests, make sure that they are \nusing a lab that has been certified under CLIA(the Clinical Laboratory \nImprovement Act).  \n\nA diet analysis may be helpful since many nutrient reserves have been shown \nto correlate fairly well with the dietary intake as monitored by food logging \nand software analysis(Nutritionist IV and other software programs).  But \nthere are still about half of the nutrients required by humans that do not \nshow a very good correlation between apparent dietary intake and reserve status.\nUntil we have more nutritional assessment clinical labs in operation in the \nU.S. and physicians who have been trained how to use the nutritional \nprofile that these labs provide to devise a treatment approach that uses \ndiet changes and supplementation, anti-depressants will probably continue \nto be the best approach to depression.\n\nMartin Banschbach, Ph.D.\nProfessor of Biochemistry and Chairman\nDepartment of Biochemistry and Microbiology\nOSU College of Osteopathic Medicine\n\n\"Without discourse, there is no remembering, without remembering, there is \nno learning, without learning, there is only ignorance.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

But before I do, I want to \nget a few things off my chest.  I just got blasted in e-mail for my kidney \nstone posts.  Kidney stones are primarily caused by diet, as is heart \ndisease and cancer.  When I give dietary advise, it is not intended to \nencourage people reading this news group(or Sci. Med. Nutrition where I do \nmost of my posting) to avoid seeing a doctor.  Nothing can be further from \nthe truth.  Kidney stones can be caused by tumors and this possibility has to \nbe ruled out.  But once it is, diet is a good way of preventing a reoccurance.\nSame thing with heart disease and cancer, if you suspect that you may have \na problem with one of these diseases, don't use what I'm going to tell you \nor what you read in some book to avoid going to a doctor.  You have to go.\nHopefully you will find a doctor who knows enough about nutrition to help \nyou change your risk factors for both diseases as part of a treatment \nprogram(but the odds are that you will not and that's why I'm here).  When \nmy wife detected a lump in here breast I didn't say, don't worry my vitamin \nE will take care of it.  Any breast lump has to be worked up by a physician, \nplan and simple.  If it's begnin(which most are) fine, then maybe a diet \nchange and supplementation will prevent further breast lumps from occuring.\nBut let me tell you right now, if you have tried diet and supplementation \nand another lump returns, get your butt into the doctor's office as fast as \nyour little feet can carry you(better yet, have a mammography done on a \nregular basis, my wife kept putting her's off, both myself and her \ngynocologist told her she needed to have one done).  Her gynocologist even \nscheduled one, but she didn't show up(too busy running the Operating Room for \nthe biggest Hospital in Tulsa).\n\nOne more thing, I am not an orthomolecular nutritionist.  This group uses \nhigh dose vitamins and minerals to treat all kinds of disease.  There is \nabsolutely no doubt in my mind that vitamins and minerals can and do have \ndrug actions in the body.  But you talk about flying blind, man this is \nreally blind treatment.  No drug could ever be used as these vitamins and \nminerals are being used.  I'm not saying that some of this stuff couldn't \nbe right on the money, it may well be.  But my approach to nutrition is a \nlot like that of Weinsier and Morgan, the two M.D's who wrote the new \nClinical Nutrition textbook.  My push is the nutrient reserves and the lab \ntests needed to measure these reserves and then supplementation or diet \nchanges to get these reserves built up to where they should be to let you \nhandle stress.  That's where I'm coming from folks.  Blast away if you want,\nI'm not going to change.  Put me in your killfile if you want, I really \ndon't care.  I'm averaging 8-10 e-mail messages a day from people who think \nthat I've got something important to say.  But I'm also getting hit by a \nfew with an axe to grind.  That's life.\n\nChromium is one of the trace elements.  It has a very limited(but very \nimportant) role in the body.  It is used to form glucose tolerance factor\n(GTF).  GTF is made up of chromium, nicinamide(niacin), glycine, cysteine \nand glutamic.  Only the chromium and the niacin are needed from the diet to \nform GTF.  Some foods already have GTF(Liver, brewers or nutritional yeast,\nand black pepper).  When chromium is in GTF, a pretty good absorption is \nseen(about 20%).  But when it is simply present as a mineral or mineral \nchelate(chromium picolinate) it's absorption is much lower(1 to 2%, lowest \nfor all the minerals).  I've been posting in Misc. Fitness and chromium has \ncome up there several times as a \"fat burner\".  Chromium is among the least \ntoxic of the minerals so you could really load yourself up and not really \ndo any harm.  I wouldn't do it though.  The adequate and safe range for \nchromium is 50 to 200ug per day.  The average American is getting about \n30ug per day from his/her diet.  Chromium levels decrease with age and many \nbelieve that adult onset diabetes is primarily a chromium deficiency.  I \ncan cite you several studies that have been done with glucose tolerance in \nType II diabetes but I'm not going to because for each positive one, there \nalso seems to be a negative one as well.  I'm convinced that the problem is \nbioavailability.  When yeast(GTF) is used, good results are obtained but when \nchromium itself is used the results are usually negative.  In addition to \nType II diabetes, chromiuum has been examined in cardiovascular disease and \nglucoma, again with mixed results as far as cardiovascular disease is \nconcerned\n\nSince a high blood glucose level can lead to cardiovascular disease, \nthis possible link with chromium isn't too surprising.  Glucoma is a little \nmore interesting.  Muscle eye focusing activity is primarily an insulin \nresponsive glucose-driven metabolic function.  If this eye focusing activity \nis impaired(by a lack of glucose due to a poor insulin response), intraocular \npressure is believed to be elevated.  In a fairly large study of 400 pts with \nglaucoma, the one consistent finding was a low RBC chromium. J. Am. Coll. \nNutr. 10(5):536,(1991).  But this one preliminary study should not prompt \npeople to go out and start popping chromium supplements.  For one thing, \njust about every older person is going to have a low RBC chromium unless \nthey have been taking chromium suppleemnts(yeast).  Since glucoma is often \nfound in older people, it's not too surprising that chromium was low in the \nRBC's.  If chromium supplementation could reverse glucoma, that would \nprompt some attention.  I suspect that there will be a clinical trail to \ncheck out this possible chromium link to glucoma.\n\nYou could find out what your body chromium pool size was by either the RBC \nchromium test or hair analysis.  Most clinical labs are not going to run a \nRBC chromium.  There are plenty of labs that will do a hair and nail \nanalysis for you, but I wouldn't use them.  There is just too much funny \nbusiness going on in these unregulated labs right now.\n\nHere's Weinsier and Morgan, advise on chromium.  They do not consider \nchromium to be one of those minerals for which a reliable clinical test is \navailable(they don't like the hair and nail analysis labs either, and they \nalso recognize the RBC chromium is primarily a research test that is not \nroutinely available in most clinical chemistry labs).  This has to change \nand as more labs run a RBC chromiuum, it will.  What then do they suggest?\nMake a diagnosis of chromium deficiency based on a documented clinical \nresponse to chromium(run a glucose tolerance test before and after chromium \nsupplementation).  Once you make the diagnosis, put the patient on 200ug of \nCrCl3 orally each day or 10grams of yeast per day.\n\nWhat's my advise?  Don't take chromium supplements to try to loose weight\n(they just do not work that way).  If you want to take them and then \nexercise, that would be great.  Do include yeast as part of your diet(most \nAmericans are not getting enough chromium from their diet).  If you do have \na poor glucose tolerance, ask your doctor to check your chromium status.  \nWhen he or she says, \"what in the world are you talking about\", just say, \nplease get a copy of Weinsier and Morgan's new Clinical Nutrition textbook \nand do what they say to do with patients who present with a poor glucose \ntolerance.  If you can't do that, I'll find a doctor who can, thank you \nvery much.\n\nMarty B.\n"

My doctor started using one recently, and I\nthought the concept was so amazing that I bought one too.  \n\nThe thing works by reading the infrared emissions from the ear drum.\nThe ear drum is hotter than the ear canal walls, so you have to point\nthe thing very carefully.  This means tugging on the top of the ear\nto straighten out the ear canal, then inserting the thing snugly, then\npushing a button.  Unfortunately, there are many things that can go wrong.\nIt is almost impossible to aim the thing correctly when you do it on \nyourself.  I get readings which differ from each other by up to 2 degrees,\nand may differ from an oral thermometer by up to 2 degrees.  \n\nI talked to one of the nurses in my doctor's office recently about this,\nand she said she didn't like them either, for same reasons.  She did give\nme some instruction on how to tug on my ear, and what correct insertion\nfeels like, but she said she thought it was impossible to do correctly\non one's self.  She also said that she and other nurses had complained to\nthe company about inaccurate readings, and that someone from the company\nhad told them to take great care to clean the infrared window at the end\nof the probe with alcohol from time to time.  She demonstrated this prior\nto reading my temperature, and managed to get a reading within 0.5 degree\nof the oral temperature I took at home before driving to the Dr's office.\n\nI have also noticed tha some nurses click the button, then remove the\nprobe immediately.  This causes wrong readings.  In my experience, you\nhave to leave the probe in a good 1 to 2 seconds after clicking the button\nto get a good measurement.  The nurse I talked with agreed.  I suspect\nthat many people don't realize this, and therefore get bad readings for\nyet another reason.\n\nIn short, it's a great idea.  It may work for some folks, but I believe\nit doesn't work well for a person who wants to take his own temperature.\n\n"

The manifest is also available from the Ames SPACE\n    archive in SPACE/FAQ/manifest.

For the most up to date information on upcoming\n    missions, call (407) 867-INFO (867-4636) at Kennedy Space Center.\n\n    Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news\n    frequently.\n\n\n    WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF?\n\n    The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks\n    (kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov).\n\n    The \"Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual,\" ASC G&C 2102,\n    says:\n\n\t\"During the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude is\n\tcommanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower\n\tclearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)\n\torients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a\n\tnegative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other\n\tadvantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort\n\tmaneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of\n\tthe horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining\n\tdownrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target\n\tin second stage.\"\n\n    This really is a good answer, but it's couched in NASA jargon. I'll try\n    to interpret.\n\n    1)\tWe wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.\n\n    2)\tThen, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack\n\tbetween the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the\n\t\"relative wind\") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line\n\tbetween the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly\n\tnegative angle (\"a negative q-alpha\").\tThis causes a little bit of\n\t\"downward\" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z\n\tdirection) and this force \"alleviates structural loading.\"\n\tWe have to be careful about those wings -- they're about the\n\tmost \"delicate\" part of the vehicle.\n\n    3)\tThe new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more\n\tmass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or\n\tto change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be\n\tthe case if we didn't roll (\"performance gain\").\n\n    4)\tThe new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated\n\tflight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort\n\tmaneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (\"decreased abort maneuver\n\tcomplexity\").\n\n    5)\tThe new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio\n\tantennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio\n\tantennae on the Orbiter (\"improved S-band look angles\").\n\n    6)\tThe new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a\n\thelpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.\n\n    7)\tThe new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is\n\tmore nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east\n\t(usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity\n\tin the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:\n\tvelocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.\n\tThe Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its\n\tvelocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.\n\n    This all begs the question, \"Why isn't the launch pad oriented to give\n    this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to\n    achieve that attitude?\"  The answer is that the pads were leftovers\n    from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one\n    for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main\n    Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime\n    launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is\n    fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the \"top\"\n    [Orbiter side] and the \"bottom\" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The\n    access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented\n    basically the same way they were for the Saturn V's.  (A side note: the\n    Saturn V's also had a roll program.  Don't ask me why -- I'm a Shuttle\n    guy.)\n\n    I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.\tHe added that the \"roll\n    maneuver\" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.\n    The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons\n    stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping\n    the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw\n    component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total\n    maneuver is really expressed as a \"quaternion,\" a grad-level-math\n    concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element\n    array.\n\n\n    HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT\n\n    NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite\n    dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72\n    degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed\n    over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from\n    California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.\n    shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite\n    for these viewers.\n\n    If you can't get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.\n    It's worth asking if yours doesn't.\n\n    The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is\n    frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press\n    conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle\n    missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying\n    much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions\n    are not being covered.\n\n\n    AMATEUR RADIO FREQUENCIES FOR SHUTTLE MISSIONS\n\n    The following are believed to rebroadcast space shuttle mission audio:\n\n\tW6FXN  - Los Angeles\n\tK6MF   - Ames Research Center, Mountain View, California\n\tWA3NAN - Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Greenbelt, Maryland.\n\tW5RRR  - Johnson Space Center (JSC), Houston, Texas\n\tW6VIO  - Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, California.\n\tW1AW Voice Bulletins\n\n\tStation    VHF\t   10m\t   15m\t   20m\t  40m\t 80m\n\t------\t ------  ------  ------  ------  -----\t-----\n\tW6FXN\t 145.46\n\tK6MF\t 145.585\t\t\t 7.165\t3.840\n\tWA3NAN\t 147.45  28.650  21.395  14.295  7.185\t3.860\n\tW5RRR\t 146.64  28.400  21.350  14.280  7.227\t3.850\n\tW6VIO\t 224.04\t\t 21.340  14.270\n\tW6VIO\t 224.04\t\t 21.280  14.282  7.165\t3.840\n\tW1AW\t\t 28.590  21.390  14.290  7.290\t3.990\n\n    W5RRR transmits mission audio on 146.64, a special event station on the\n    other frequencies supplying Keplerian Elements and mission information.\n\n    W1AW also transmits on 147.555, 18.160.

He is a recognized world\nauthority on lunar materials refinement.  He has written or\ncoauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrial\nmaterials processing or utilization.  Along with Dr. David\nCriswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.\n\n   Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legal\nexperts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to build\nthe Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with a\npotential to power the globe.\n\n   For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly half\nfrom California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientific\nconcept of a solar power system based on the Moon.\n\n   The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunar\nsurface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmitted\nthrough orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormous\nsource of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earth's ever\nincreasing demand using proven, basic technology.\n\n   OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Space\nIndustrialization) is the Greater Los Angeles chapter of the\nNational Space Society, which is an international non-profit\norganization that promotes development of the space frontier.\nThe Ventura County chapter is based in Oxnard, CA.\n\n       WHERE:  Rockwell Science Center Auditorium, 1049 Camino\n               Dos Rios, Thousand Oaks, CA.\n\n   DIRECTIONS: Ventura Freeway 101 to Thousand Oaks, exit onto\n               Lynn Road heading North (right turn from 101\n               North, Left turn from 101 South), after about 1/2\n               mile turn Left on Camino Dos Rios, after about 1/2\n               mile make First Right into Rockwell after Camino\n               Colindo, Parking at Top of Hill to the Left\n\n"

It\nwould be a drive using thermonuclear explosions to drive a spacecraft.\nThe idea was that you'd detonate devices with somewhere from one to\nten megatons yield behind a \"pusher plate\" attached to the main\nspacecraft.  The shock wave from the explosions would transfer\nmomentum to the ship.\n\n  Now, in an atmosphere I can see this.  The energy of the explosion\nheats the atmosphere, which expands explosively and slams a shock wave\ninto the pusher plate.  But in a vacuum, only two things I can see are\ngoing to hit the plate: fission/fusion products (barium, krypton,\nhelium, neutrons, evaporated bomb casing) and electromagnetic\nradiation (gammas mostly, some light/heat from irradiated fission\nproducts).\n\n  Would this work?  I can't see the EM radiation impelling very much\nmomentum (especially given the mass of the pusher plate), and it seems\nto me you're going to get more momentum transfer throwing the bombs\nout the back of the ship than you get from detonating them once\nthey're there.\n\n  I must be missing something.  Would someone enlighten me via email?\n\n  Thanks.\n\n-- \n\t--Jim\n\n---\nJim Goltz                    AlterNet Engineer               goltz@uunet.uu.net\n"

I have several friends at the Moscow Aviation\nInstitute who have asked me to post this announcement.  (I have done\nsome editing, but the contents is unchanged from the original\nannouncement.) \n\nFor those of you not familiar with the Moscow Aviation Institute, it is\nthe leading Russian school of higher education dedicated to the training\nof aircraft and spacecraft designers.  It specializes in airframe\ndesign, powerplant design, control systems, and power systems.\nVirtually all of the major former Soviet airframe designers (Tupolev,\nSu, Iluchine, Migoyan, etc.) were schooled at MAI.\n\nI had the opportunity to tour the two museums that are maintained at\nMAI.  The aircraft include Mig23, Su 27, Yak 38, the cockpit of an\nF-111(!), among others.  It was a fascinating and eye opening\nexperience, expecially given the fact that the museum was, until a year\nor so ago, closed to virtually everyone.  I also had the opportunity to\nsee some of the experiments being conducted with plasma drive engines\nfor future space craft use.\n\nIf you have any questions about the Institute, or the program, I would\nbe glad to try and answer them.  The institute, and most of it's faculty\nhave e-mail addresses.  However, it takes about a day or so for the\nreceiver to get the message.

Customers included government (including NASA), for profit and\nnon-profit companies. All expected a wrap (usually called a fee). Much\nof the work involved allocating and costing the work of subcontractors.\nThe subcontractors where universities, for-profits, non-profits, and\neven some of the NASA Centers for the Commercialization of Space. ALL\ncharged fees as part of the work. Down the street is one of the NASA\ncommercialization centers; they charge a fee.\n\nNow, I'm sure your a competent engineer Dennis, but you clearly lack\nexperience in several areas. Your posts show that you don't understand\nthe importance of integration in large projects. You also show a lack\nof understanding of costing efforts as shown by your belief that it\nis reasonable to charge incremental costs for everything. This isn't\na flame, jsut a statement.\n\nYour employer DOES charge a fee. You may not see it but you do.\n\n>>Sounds like they are adding it to their overhead rate. Go ask your\n>>costing people how much fee they add to a project.\n\n>I did they never heard of it but suggest that, like our president did, that\n>any percentage number like this is included in the overhead.\n\nWell there you are Dennis. As I said, they simply include the fee in\ntheir overhead. Many seoparate the fee since the fee structure can\nchange depending on the customer.\n\n>No Allen you did not.

When\nWP 02 was hemoraging out a billion $$, the centers you love so much where\ndoing their best to cover it up and ignore the problem. Reston was the\nonly place you would find people actually interested in solving the\nproblems and building a station.\n\n>Kinda funny isn't it that someone who talks about a problem like this is\n>at a place where everything is overhead.\n\nWhen you have a bit more experience Dennis, you will realize that\nintegration isn't overhead.

Methinks that you are being \n>selective with the facts again.\n\nThe story you refer to said that some NASA people blamed it on\nCongress. Suprise suprise. The fact remains that it is the centers\nyou support so much who covered up the overheads and wouldn't address\nthe problems until the press published the story.\n\nAre you saying the Reston managers where wrong to get NASA to address\nthe overruns? You approve of what the centers did to cover up the overruns?\n\n>If it takes four flights a year to resupply the station and you have a cost\n>of 500 million a flight then you pay 2 billion a year.

Unlike the conventional large \nVHF radars, in which output power of a large vacuum tube is distributed \nto individual antenna elements, each of 475 solid state power amplifier \nfeeds each antenna element. This system configuration enables very fast \nbeam steering as well as various flexible operations by dividing the \nantenna into independent subarrays, because phase shift and signal \ndivision/combination are performed at a low signal level using \nelectronic devices under control of a computer network. The antenna \nbeam can be switched within 10 microsec to any direction within the \nzenith angle of 30 deg. Since a precise phase alignment of each element \nis crucial to realize the excellent performance of this system, careful \ncalibration of the output phase of each power amplifier and antenna \nelement was carried out. Among various aircraft which may be used for \nthis purpose artificial satellites have an advantage of being able to \nmake a long term monitoring with the same system. An antenna pattern \nmonitoring system for the MU radar was developed using the scientific \nsatellite OHZORA (EXOS-C). A receiver named MUM (MU radar antenna \nMonitor) on board the satellite measures a CW signal of 100 to 400 \nwatts transmitted from the MU radar. The principle of the measurement \nand results are discussed.\n\n\nEquatorial radar system\nFUKAO, SHOICHIRO;  TSUDA, TOSHITAKA; SATO, TORU; KATO, SUSUMU\n(Kyoto University, Uji, Japan)\n(COSPAR, IAGA, SCOSTEP, et al., Plenary Meeting, 27th,\nWorkshops and Symposium on the Earth's Middle Atmosphere,\nEspoo, Finland, July 18-29, 1988) Advances in Space Research\n(ISSN 0273-1177), vol. 10, no. 10, 1990, p. 151-154.\n     A large clear air radar with the sensitivity of an incoherent \nscatter radar for observing the whole equatorial atmosphere up to 1000 \nkm altitude is now being designed in Japan.

It will have a PA product of about \n3 x 10 to the 9th W sq m (P = average transmitter power, A = effective \nantenna aperture) with a sensitivity of approximately 10 times that of \nthe MU radar. This system configuration enables pulse-to-pulse beam \nsteering within 20 deg from the zenith. As is the case of the MU radar, \na variety of operations will be made feasible under the supervision of \nthe radar controller. A brief description of the system configuration \nis presented. \n\n"

However, the rumors\n>I hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter\n>seems more likely.\n\nYo Ken, let's keep on-top of things! Both the \"External Tank\" and\n\"Wingless Orbiter\" options have been deleted from the SSF redesign\noptions list. Today's (4/23) edition of the New York Times reports\nthat O'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals have\nbeen dropped, such as using the \"giant external fuel tanks used\nin launching space shuttles,\" and building a \"station around\nan existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed.\"\n\nCurrently, there are three options being considered, as presented\nto the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported in\ntoday's Times).\n\nOption \"A\" - Low Cost Modular Approach\nThis option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside,\nthere are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supporting\nthe SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC and\nReston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respective\nteams with their redesign activities.} Key features of this\noption are:\n  -  Uses \"Bus-1\", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that's\n     qualified for STS and ELV's. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C\n     Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this\n     for the Air Force.\n  -  A \"Power Station Capability\" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.\n     SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle\n     flies in an \"arrow mode\" to optimize the microgravity environment.\n     Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power\n     source for 30 day missions.\n  -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term\n     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the\n     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing\n     SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International\n     Partners' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The\n     Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.\n     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.\n  -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and\n     add another 20 kW of power\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,\n     the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return\n     Vehicle).\n\nOption \"B\" - Space Station Freedom Derived\nThe Option \"B\" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin.\nThis option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we\nhave all come to know and love :)\n\nThis option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for\nuse on all SSF assembly flights (so does option \"A\"). Also, the \nnumber of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,\nfor both options \"A\" and \"B\".\n\nThe build-up occurs in six phases:\n  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power\n     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when\n     it visits.\n  -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist\n     language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is\n     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by\n     keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes\n     there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the\n     second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).\n  -  A \"Two Fault Tolerance Capability\" is achieved after 14 flights,\n     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal\n     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.\n  -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,\n     the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the\n     assembly in 24 flights.\n\nMost of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option, \nwith the exception of the data management system, which has major\nchanges.\n\nOption C - Single Core Launch Station.\nThis is the JSC lead option. Basically, you take a 23 ft diameter\ncylinder that's 92 ft long, slap 3 Space Shuttle Main Engines on\nthe backside, put a nose cone on the top, attached it to a \nregular shuttle external tank and a regular set of solid rocket\nmotors, and launch the can. Some key features are:\n  - Complete end-to-end ground integration and checkout\n  - 4 tangentially mounted fixed solar panels\n  - body mounted radiators (which adds protection against\n    micrometeroid & orbital debris)\n  - 2 centerline docking ports (one on each end)\n  - 7 berthing ports\n  - a single pressurized volume, approximately 26,000 cubic feet\n    (twice the volume of skylab).\n  - 7 floors, center passageway between floors\n  - 10 kW of housekeeping power\n  - graceful degradation with failures (8 power channels, 4 thermal\n    loops, dual environmental control & life support system)\n  - increased crew time for utilization\n  - 1 micro-g thru out the core module\n"

Even then getting\nthe spectrum is very hard, but conceivable.\n\n\tIf we know anything about physics at that level,\nthe bursters are not due to quantum black holes or cosmic\nstrings, wrong spectrum for one thing.\n\nThe situation is further complicated by recent claims that\nthere are two classes of sources ;-)  [in the colliding NS\nthey'd actually probably fit relatively easily into the\nNS-NS and NS-BH collision scenarios respectively]\n\n   my own pet theory is that it's  Flying saucers  entering\n   hyperspace :-)\n\n   but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes  that they\n   are  colliding nuetron stars  or  spinning black holes,  i just wondered\n   if any mechanism could exist  and place them  closer in.\n\nIf you can think of one, remember to invite me to Stockholm...\n\n*  Steinn Sigurdsson   \t\t\tLick Observatory      \t*\n*  steinly@lick.ucsc.edu\t\t\"standard disclaimer\"  \t*\n*  The laws of gravity are very,very strict\t\t\t*\n*  And you're just bending them for your own benefit - B.B. 1988*\n"

It was a bit shorter\nthan I expected.  Last year (when the stock was first down), they made a big\npresentation on the 777, and other programs.  This year, it was much more\nbare-bones.\n\nIn any case, I wanted to ask a question that the board of directors would\nhear, and so I got there early, and figured that If I didn't get to the mike,\nmaybe they would read mine off of a card, and so I wrote it down, and handed it\nin.\n\nAfter the meeting started, Mr. Shrontz said that he would only answer written\nquestions, in order to be fair to the people in the overflow room that only\nhad monitors downstairs.  Naturally, I was crushed.\n\nSo, when question and answer time came, I was suprised to find my question\nbeing read and answered.  Admittedly near the end of the ones that he took.\nPresumably getting there early, and getting the question in early made all\nthe difference.\n\nSo, on to the substance. The question was \n\nIs Boeing looking at anything BEYOND the high speed Civil Transport, such\nas a commercial space launch system, and if not, how will Boeing compete\nwith the reusable single stage to orbit technology presently being developed\nby Mcdonnell Douglass?\n\nWell, he read it without a hitch, and without editing, with impressed me,\nthen he answered it very quickly treating it as a two part question, last\npart first.\n\nThis is to the best of my recollection what he said.\n\nAs far as single stage to orbit technology, we think that we have a better\nanswer in a two stage approach, and we are talking to some of our customers \nabout that.  As far as commercialization, that is a long ways off.  The High\nspeed Civil Transport is about as far out as our commercial planning goes at\nthis point.\n\nSo, this tells me that Boeing still considers space to be a non-commercial\narena, and for the most part this is true, however it also tells me that \nthey consider there to be enough money in building space launchers for them\nto persue work on their own.\n\nNow, I do have a friend on the spacelifter program at boeing.  Actually,\nthis is a mis-nomer, as there is no spacelifter contract for the work that this\nguy is doing, however, he is doing work in preparation of a proposal for space\nlifter contracts.  He won't tell me what he is doing, but maybe this is where\nthe TSTO action is taking place at boeing.  At the very minimum, the chairman\nof the board of boeing said that they have an approach in mind, and they are\ntrying to do something with it.  \n\nAnybody know anything further?\nIs this really news?\nDoes this threaten further work on DC-? ?\n\n                    John.\n"

With three detectors properly arranged, one can often\nget positions down to ~arc minutes.\n\nBTW, about Oort cloud sources: shouldn't this be testable in the\nfairly near future?  Some of the GRBs have very short rise times (< 1\nms).  We could detect the curvature of the burst wavefront out to a\ndistance of on the order of b^2/(t c) where b is the detector spacing\nand t the time resolution.  For t = 1 ms and b = 2 AU, this is on the\norder of 16 light years.

Then someone, who can understand a\ngood argument, comes along and asks \"why don't you just develop the spinoffs?\"\nor \"why can't we just get our spinoffs from some other program, like the\nmilitary?\"  There are some good arguments for space development without relying\non its side effects.

This week they sent\nsomething *very* interesting. It was an article written by the leader of a\nnational (US) Christian school organization about a trip he recently made\nto Jerusalem. While there, he was introduced to one of the rabbis who is\nworking on a project to rebuild the Temple at Jerusalem. The article\nincluded photos of the many furnishings that have already been made in\npreparation for furnishing the rebuilt temple according to the\nspecifications given in the Bible. \n\nWhat was even more striking is the fact that the plans for the temple are\ncomplete and the group is only awaiting permission from the Israeli\ngovernment before beginning the building. The other startling fact is the\nvery recent archeological discovery that the original site of the temple is\nunoccupied and available for building. Previously it has been thought that\nthe original site was underneath what is now a mosque, making rebuilding\nimpossible without sparking a holy war. \n\nNow it appears that nothing stands in the way of rebuilding and resuming\nsacrifices, as the Scriptures indicate will happen in the last days.\nAlthough the Israeli government will give the permission to start, I think\nit is the hand of God holding the project until He is ready to let it\nhappen.

Biblical teaching expects us to celebrate the\nresurrection of Christ not once a year but every time someone is baptized.\n Col. 2:12-Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him\nthrough the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the\ndead.\"  Rom. 6:4-Therefore we are buried with him in baptism into death:\nthat like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the\nFather, even so we also should walk in newness of life.\"\nThose really want to celebrate the resurrection should by faith walk in\nnewness of life after baptism.

This\ndoesn't mean that environmentalism is wrong, any more than supporting peace in\nthe Middle East is wrong because Jews and Muslims also work for it.\n\n  Nonetheless, paganism is certainly on the rise, and we as Christians should\naddress this and look at what draws people from paganism to Christianity.  Like\nit or not, pagan religions are addressing needs that Christianity should be,\nand isn't.  \n  I believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that Christianity has\nforgotten.  This doesn't mean that paganism is right, but it does mean that we\nhave something to learn from the pagan movement.\n  First, paganism respects the feminine.  Christianity has a long history of\noppressing women, and many (if not most) male Christians are still unable to\nlive in a non-sexist manner.  The idea that God is sexless, or that Christ \ncould have been a women and still accomplished his mission, is met with a great\ndeal of resistance.  This insistance on a male-dominated theology (and the \nmale-dominated society that goes with it) drives away many young women who have\nhad to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches.\n  Second, paganism respects the physical world.  This is an idea with great\nramifications.  One of these is environmentalism--respect for our surroundings\nand our world.  Another is integration of sexuality.  Christianity has a long\ntradition of calling ALL sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppress\nand deny their sexuality.  This is too much--sex is clearly a part of human\nexperience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option.  \nChristianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic, and paganism\nis an attractive option.\n  I'm not advocating that Christian doctrines (no sex before marriage, etc.)\nshould be changed--just that Christians work toward a more moderate ethic of\nsexuality.  Denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderated\nsexuality, and neither one does much to bring us closer to God.\n\nAlan Terlep\t\t\t\t    \"Incestuous vituperousness\"\nOakland University, Rochester, MI\t\t\t\natterlep@vela.acs.oakland.edu\t\t\t\t   --Melissa Eggertsen\nRushing in where angels fear to tread.\t\t\n"

At that time,\nI started taking my daughter to church quite often, although not every weekend.\nI did this to attempt to strengthen the Christian ethic and expose her to a\nreligious community.\n\nToday, Easter Sunday, I took my daughter to church. When it came time for \nCommunion, my daughter took the bread (The body of Christ) but left the wine\n(The blood of Christ) professing that she was too young for wine. She then\nballed the bread up in her hand and tried to descretely throw it under the\npew in front of us.\n\nI feel this was a slap in the face to me, my religion, and an afront to her\nreligious heritage. It can be construed as breaking several of the commandments\nif you try. I really felt dishonored by the action.\n\nMy daughter is only nine years old, but I think she should have been old and\nmature enough to realize her actions. I have difficulty blaming her directly\nfor religious teachings her mother swears to, but when I discussed this with\nmy daughter she made it clear she believed in Buddhism and not Christianity.\n\nMy initial response of anger (moderated) was to suggest if there is no faith\nin Christ then why does she celebrate Easter, or Christmas? I suggested I\nwould never force her to practice my religious beliefs by celebrating holidays\nwith her again.\n\nI do not want to \"drive her from the fold\", and would be willing to allow her\nto continue practicing Buddhism (as though I had a choice seeing her only\nfor two days out of fourteen) but I want her to want to embrace Christianity.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nIf you have a response, please e-mail me a copy. (I'm not a regular reader\nof this newsgroup.) (Naturally, feel free to post too!)\n\nThanks, and I hope you've had a happy Easter.\n\nDrew\n\n-- \nDrew Watson                 Systems analysis             Encore Computer Corp\ndwatson@encore.com     (301)497-1800 || (703)691-3500       Customer services\n=============================================================================\n"

What I see as arrogance and the problem I have \nwith it is not a sense of personal certainty, but a lack of respect for\nothers who come to differing conclusions.  Clearly, this is not just \nChristian vs. Non-Christian; there is a whole spectrum of belief systems\nwithin Christianity.  I do not tend to argue with others about matters\nof personal faith because, like aesthetics, it is not demonstable by\nobjective means.  \n\nChoosing what to believe and rely on are important areas of personal \nsovereignty.  What bothers me is when others suggest that, in these \nmatters of faith, their specific beliefs are not only true to them \nbut are absolute and should be binding on others.  It follows from this\nthat God must give everyone the same revelation of truth, and thus \nanyone who comes to a different conclusion is intentionally choosing\nthe wrong path.  This is the arrogance I see; a lack of respect for the\nhonest conclusions of others on matters which are between them and God.\nEven a personal certainty leaves room for the beliefs of others.  It is\nuniversalizing those matters of personal faith, coupled by a proud\nnotion that one's relationship with God is superior to other's, that\nleads to arrogance.  In my honest (and nonuniversal) opinion. :-)\n\n\n>Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\n>\"At the core of all well-founded belief, lies belief that is unfounded.\"\n>                                                    -- Ludwig Wittgenstein\n\ncomments, criticism welcome...\n-Ken\nalvin@ucsu.colorado.edu\n\n[It is certainly reasonable to ask for some humility about our own\nability to know the truth.

I have suggested in the past that God\nmay be less concerned about doctrinal agreement than many people are.\nBut that doesn't mean I doubt that there is a difference between\ntrue and false, nor that I think there is no benefit in finding out\nwhat is true.  --clh]\n"

(And there are plenty of other examples.)\n>Can you reconcile this?\n\nThe problem you see here is that some Christians claim things about\nthe Bible which they don't actually believe or practice. I've known\nall sorts of Christians, ranging from the trendiest of liberals to\nthe fire-breathing fundamentalists, and although many on the \nconservative side of the Christian faith do claim that the Bible is\na (perhaps *the*) source of absolute truth, I don't know of anyone\nwho treats it as anything other than a valuable part of a living tradition.\nWhile I am not a Roman Catholic, I believe this is close to the official\nposition of the RC church (perhaps an RC would like to comment).\n\nThe particular practice you refer to will usually be explained in\nterms of the social context of the time. You would think the fact \nthat the conservatives seem to have to break out the tophat-and-cane \nand give you some big song-and-dance routine about why this \n(other passages as well) aren't directly applicable today would \nshow them that what they claim about the Bible and what they \nactually practice are two different things, but mostly it doens't.\n\nWhile this thread is supposed to be about the arrogance of Christians,\nI would suggest that some of the problem is really hypocrasy, in this\ncase, making claims about the Bible which the claimants don't actually\nput into practice. But if we step back from the name-calling and\nlook at what people are attempting to say, we see that they are trying\nto express very concisely the unique place the Bible holds within the\nChristian faith. So when people use such words or phrases as \"Word of\nGod\", \"inerrant\", \"infallibale\", \"The Manufacturer's Handbook\", \"The\nonly rule of faith and practice in the church today\" to describe the\nBible, we should try to hear what they are saying and not just look at\nthe mere words they use. Some of the above descriptions are demostratably\nfalse and others are self-contradictory, but in my experience people are\ngenerally pretty good at picking out the intention of the speaker even\nwhen the speaker's words are at variance with their intentions. A Biblical\nexample is from the garden of Eden where God asks \"Where are you?\" and Adam\nexplains that he was naked and afraid and hid himself. If Adam had\nanswered God's words he would have said something like \"I'm here in this\ntree.\" The problem seems to arise when Christians insist that these\nwords are indeed accurate reflections of their beleif. Most people\nhave not made a determined effort to work out their own understanding of\nthe place of the Bible within their own faith and so rely on the phrases\nand explanations that others use.\n\nI hope this helps.\n--\n                                                                     ___\nBill Rea                                                            (o o)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------w--U--w---\n| Bill Rea, Computer Services Centre, | E-Mail   b.rea@csc.canterbury.ac.nz |\n| University of Canterbury,           | or     cctr114@csc.canterbury.ac.nz |\n| Christchurch, New Zealand           | Phone (03)-642-331 Fax (03)-642-999 |\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"

The dear old aunt (now \ndeceased) was very proud of her Jewish heritage, although not especially\ndevout.  Her parents were both murdered in Nazi concentration camps in\nAustria during WWII because they were Jewish.  While conversing with her\nabout politics, world affairs and religion, she remarked that it would \nbe a good idea for me to visit her niece on my return to Atlanta.\n\nWithin two days of returning to Atlanta, her niece called to invite\nme over for dinner with her husband.  I went, not knowing really what to\nexpect, other than stimulating conversation and fellowship.  What I got,\nhowever, was rather unexpected.  The thrust of the evening's discussion\nwas to condemn the Reagan-Bush policies prohibiting abortion counseling \nin federally funded family planning clinics, prohibiting the sterilization\nof minorities on welfare here and in Puerto Rico, on\nthe ban on fetal tissue research, and against the Mexico City policy,\n\"which denies U.S. foreign aid to programs overseas that promote abortion.\"\n\nThe crux of their position was to place the blame for the problems of\n\"overpopulation,\" rampant domestic crime, African starvation, unwed\nmothers, etc., on Christianity, rather on the fall of Adam.  Now, this\nis not what I had to come to talk about.  But every time I tried to \nbring up the subject of Judaism, they would condemn Jews for Jesus\nand admonish me against converting to Judaism, \"because it involves\ntoo much study and effort.\"  And I did not even raise the prospect, nor\ntry to convert them to the truth of Christ!  There was certainly no\nJewish proselytism going on there.\n\nAnd again, last November I toured a \"traditional\" Jewish synagogue and was\nsubjected to a 30-minute harangue against Jesus and Christianity in\ngeneral.  I realize that these are two isolated incidents, and that the\nbest supervisor I ever had at work is Jewish, but from my experience,\nthe modern Jew is not known for his proselytism.\n\n \n-- \nboundary\n\nno teneis que pensar que yo haya venido a traer la paz a la tierra; no he\nvenido a traer la paz, sino la guerra (Mateo 10:34, Vulgata Latina) \n"

I would refer you to John Dominic Crossans Book _The Cross That\nSpoke_ (Pub. Harper and Row, 1988).  The earliest texts which we have make no\nreference to an empty tomb.  Nor is an empty tomb necessary for a claim of\nresurrection. Modern Evangelicals/Fundamentalists have completely missed what\nthe point of resurrection is -- Here the work of George Nickelsburg's work \n_Resurrection, Immortality, and Eternal Life in Intertestamental Judaism_ (Publ\nCambridge, Havard Univ. Press, 1972) is most helpful.  Look At Rom 1:1-3.  Paul\nhere has no need of an empty tomb.  Additionally in 1 Cor 15, Here again there\nis no mention of an empty tomb. He was raised (note the passive), he appeared,\nno ascension either.\n\nResurrection could be accomplished without ever disturbing the bones in the\ngrave.  The whole idea of an empty tomb isn't broached in any of our texts\nuntil well after the fall of Jerusalem.  By that time, the idea of coming up\nwith a body would have been ludicrious.  Moreover Mack has argued (convicingly,\nI think) that the empty tomb story first appears in Mark (we have no texts\nbefore this which mention the tomb). \n    \n\n> \n> Now, you say that you think that the disciples stole the body.

God's intentions may be interfered with,\neven temporarily defeated by the will of humankind, brought down by\ncircumstance.  His ultimate will (the reconcilication of all\nhumankind) will never be stopped.\n\nTime after time, Weatherhead used the Cross as the best description of\nthis process at work.  His points, paraphrased, were 1) God's\nintentional will was for Jesus, the Christ, to live out a full life\nand perform the work of the Living God.  2) The failures, sins, and\ndeviousness of humankind frustrated God's intent for His Son.  3)\nDespite the circumstance, God's ultimate will was revealed in the\nCross, as Jesus willingly (\"not my will, Lord, but yours\") died for\nthe redemption of all humankind.

We need reason, as Darren himself has pointed\nout, to comprehend God's revelation of himself in the Bible.\nBut reason alone is not sufficient to comprehend and believe\nthe Word.  We need, first and foremost, faith.  For \"the sinful\nmind is hostile to God.  It does not submit to God's law,\n*nor can it do so*\"  (Romans 8:7).\n\nLuther accepted Scripture as the sole means of revelation\n(\"Sola Scriptura\"), but accepted the necessity of the use\nof reason (with faith) in comprehending that revelation.\nYet Luther also said, regarding baptism, \"But mad reason\nrushes forth, and, because Baptism is not dazzling like\nthe works which we do, regards it as worthless.\" (Large\nCatechism, Fourth part, Baptism).  To make matters more\ncomplicated, Luther was the sort of theologian that many \npeople would describe as an `absolutist'.  I've seen him \ndescribed as a `take no prisoners' theologian.\n\nWe might conclude, given these observations, that Luther\nwas inconsistent or mad.  And surely at least some have\ncome to that conclusion.  But it might be useful to\nrecall that Jesus was also called mad.  And Peter felt\ncompelled to defend himself and the apostles against\na charge of drunkenness on Pentecost.  So we as Christians\nought to be careful about rejecting Luther (or others) \nas mad.  Rather, we should imitate the Bereans, who\nexamined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul\nsaid was true (Acts 17:11).\n\nThe basis for the confidence with which Luther, Peter, Paul, and many\nothers preached the gospel was not just reason, but faith and the Holy\nSpirit.  This is not faith divorced from reason, but a faith that\nguides, informs, and uses reason.  The Spirit enables us to know the\ntruth and to proclaim it boldly.  God does not want us to preach the\nmessage that \"I think that Jesus might have risen from the dead\" but\nrather \"I know that my redeemer lives!\"  (Job 19:25).  The Christian\ndoes not side with Pilate in saying \"What is truth?\" but rather\nfollows Christ, who said, \"In fact, for this reason I was born, and\nfor this I came into the world, to testify to the truth.  Everyone on\nthe side of truth listens to me\" (John 18:37).\n\nWe can know the truth because God has promised us that we can\nknow the truth.  Jesus said, \"If you hold to my teachings,\nyou are really my disciples.  Then you will know the truth,\nand the truth will set you free\" (John 8:31,32).  The Proverbs\nurge us \"Buy the truth, and do not sell it.\" (Pr 23:23).\nThe Psalmist prayed \"Do not snatch to word of truth from my mouth\"\n(Ps 119:43).  Evidently he believed that the word of truth\nwas in fact `in his mouth'.  \n\nYet we do indeed appear arrogant if our claim to the truth\nis motivated by self-glorification.  But if we present the\ntruth as the teachings of Scripture, revealed by the \nSpirit, and not our own invention, and if we stand ready\nto be proved wrong on the basis of Scripture, as Luther\ndid, then we are not arrogant, but humble.  We should humbly\ntrust in God's promise of truth, just as we trust in his\npromise of forgiveness.\n\nREXLEX> It is only because of God's own revelation that we can be \nREXLEX> absolute about a thing.\n\nDarren> But how far does that get you?  Once God's revelation stops,\nDarren> and your own reasoning begins, possibility for error appears.\n\nI agree that we must make a distinction between the clear teachings\nof Scripture, and the products of our own reason--even when such\nreasoning is based on Scripture.  However I think I would draw\nthe line of distinction more `reasonably'  :-)  and less `academically'\nthan you would.\n\nDarren> For example, let's suppose that our modern Bible translations\nDarren> include a perfect rendering of Jesus words at the Last Supper,\nDarren> and that Jesus said, exactly, \"This is my body.\"\n\nDarren> We'll presume that what he said was totally without error and\nDarren> absolutely true.  What can we be certain of?  Not much.\n\nDarren> At the moment he stops speaking, and people start\nDarren> interpreting, the possibility of error appears.  Did he mean\nDarren> that literally or not?  We do not have any record that he\nDarren> elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of Tran- or Con-\nDarren> substantiation?  He didn't say. \n\nDarren is almost at the point of making a very Lutheran statement\nabout the Lord's supper.  The Lutheran approach is to say\nthat if Jesus said, \"This is my body,\" then that is what we\nshould believe.  Other interpretations are rejected simply because\nthey are not taught in Scripture.\n\nRecall that Jesus' words do not stand alone on this subject.  We also\nhave Paul's words in 1 Corinthians 11:17-34,--in which he passed on to\nus, what he received from the Lord.  In particular he said, \"For\nwhenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the\nLord's death until he comes.\"  By these words we should believe that\nthe bread that we eat in the Lord's Supper really is bread (as well as\nthe Lord's body)--as our senses in fact tell us.  Does this *prove*\nthat tran-substantiation is false?  I suppose someone could say that\nPaul spoke metaphorically of the Lord's body as bread, simply because\nthat is the way the body appears when we eat it.  But this thought is\nfound nowhere in Scripture.  So we reject it.  Thus the primary\nreason for rejecting tran-substantiation is not that we can\nprove it false, but that it is simply not found in Scripture.\n\n[side remark]\nI've been told that the Lutheran doctrine on real presence is\ncon-substantiation.  But it has been non-Lutherans who have told\nme this.  We tend not to use the word.  I almost think that this\nis used more by professors of comparative religion, who need labels\nto compare Catholic, Lutheran and Reformed teachings on the Lord's\nSupper.  But almost every church wants to call their own teaching\n\"real presence\" because that was the traditional teaching of \nthe church.\n[end side remark]\n\nDarren> When Christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning\nDarren> can never lead them astray -- when we implicitly claim that we\nDarren> are infallible -- the non- Christians around us rarely believe\nDarren> that implicit claim.  Witnessing is hardly going to work when\nDarren> the person you are talking to believes that you are either too\nDarren> foolish to recognise your own limits, or intentionally trying\nDarren> to cover them up.\n\nThis is precisely why Christians should not rely on rationalizations\nin their witnessing.  It is far better to take the approach,\n\"I'd like to show you what Scripture says.

I don't know if this is\nbelieveing blindly or not. I'm not sure how blindness comes into it. I do\nnot deny reason, indeed I insist upon it, but reason only draws conclusions\nfrom evidence. If you decide in advance that your reason will act only on\nthe evidence of the five physical senses, then you cut reason off from any\npossibility of reaching a conclusion outside the physical sphere (beyond the\nrather provocative, if inconclusive, conclusion that the physical sphere\nis not self explanatory). \n\nChristians claim that they have received a different kind of evidence, \nwhich they call faith, and which is a gift of God. That is, this evidence\nis the evidence of a thing which chooses to reveal or hide itself. The \nevidence of the senses cannot tell you is such a ting exists. Reasoning\non the evidence of the senses won't help either. But Christians do reason\nof the evidence of faith, and do claim that this evidence is wholly\nconsistent with the evidence of the other senses, and indeed, that the\nevidence of these other senses is part of God's revelation of himself\nto us.\n\nIt is not necessarilly the case however that knowledge of a God must come\nthrough this route. There may be other senses than the physical ones\nproviding evidence of non-physical realities. (There may, of course, be\nphysical realities of a type for which we have no corresponding senses, for\nall we know.) These senses, if they exist, may provide valid evidence for\nreason to work on. And, as with all senses, these senses may be impaired\nin some people, that is, they may be spiritually blind. In this sense,\nbelief in God becomes an act of sight, and it is disbelief which is blind.\n\n>You are right that science and reason cannot PROVE anything.

It is clear that human beings\nhave many systems for explaining the evidence of the physical senses, and\nsimilarly there are many systems for explaining the evidence provided by\nfaith. Religious believers in general, and Christians in particular, use\nreason to help sift through the evidence to come to a clearer understanding\nof the evidence provided by faith. Science claims, with good reason, to be\nthe most valid system for explaining the physical universe, and Christianity\nclaims, also with good reason, to be the most valid system, possessed of the\nbest evidence, for explaining Gods revelations of himself to man.\n\nIf you doubt that Christians use reason, read this newsgroup for a while\nand you will see rational debate aplenty.\n-- \n==============================================================================\nMark Baker                  | \"The task ... is not to cut down jungles, but \naa888@Freenet.carleton.ca   | to irrigate deserts.\" -- C.

Jesus did not deal explicitly with\nthe question of whether the Law was binding on Gentiles.  That's why I\nhave to cite evidence such as the way Jesus dealt with the Centurion.\n\nAs to general Jewish views on this, I am dependent largely on studies\nof Pauline theology, one by H.J. Schoeps, and one whose author I can't\ncome up with at the moment.  Both authors are Jews.  Also, various\nChristian and non-Christian Jews have discussed the issue here and in\nother newsgroups.\n\nMat 5:19 is clear that the Law is still valid.  It does not say that\nit applies to Gentiles.\n\nAnd yes, I say that the specific requirement for worship on the\nSabbath in the Ten Commandments is a ceremonial detail, when you're\nlooking at the obligations of Gentiles.  Similarly circumcision.\n\nI'm not sure quite what else I can say on this subject.  Again, it's\nunfortunate the Jesus didn't answer the question directly.  However we\ndo know (1) what the 1st Cent. Jewish approach was, (2) how Jesus\ndealt with at least one Gentile, and (3) how Jesus' disciples dealt\nwith the issue when it became more acute (I'm referring to Acts 15\nmore than Paul).

Am I mistaken with this understanding?\n\n= But if you claim that there must be\n= an answer to \"how\" did the universe (our spacetime)  emerge from \n= \"nothing\", science has some good candidates for an answer.\n\nAll of which require something we Christians readily admit to: ``Faith''.\n\nThe fact that there are several candidates belies that *none* are conclusive.  \nWith out conclusive evidence, we are left with faith.\n\nIt could even be argued that one of these hypotheses may one day be proven (as\nbest as a non-repeatable event can be \"proven\").  But I ask, what holds  \nsomeone *today* to the belief that any or all of them are correct, except by \nfaith?\n\n[ a couple of paragraphs deleted.  Summary: we ask \"Why does the\nuniverse exist\" ]\n\n= I think this question should actually be split into two parts, namely\n= \n= 1) Why is there existence? Why anything exists?\n= \n= and\n= \n= 2) How did the universe emerge from nothing?\n= \n= It is clear science has nothing to say about the first question. However,\n= is it a meaningful question, after all?\n=\n= I would say it isn't. Consider the following:\n\nApparently it *is* for many persons.  Hence, we *have* religions.\n\n= The question \"why anything exists\" can be countered by\n= demanding answer to a question \"why there is nothing in nothingness,\n= or in non-existence\".  Actually, both questions turn out to be\n= devoid of meaning. Things that exist do, and things that don't exist\n= don't exist. Tautology at its best.\n\nCarefully examine the original question, and then the \"counter-question\". \nThe first asks \"Why\", while the second is a request for definition.  It \ndoesn't address why something does or does not exist, but asks to define \nthe lack of existence.  The second question is unanswerable indeed, for\nhow do we identify something as \"nothing\" (aren't they mutually exclusive\nterms)?.  How do we identify a state of non-existence (again, this is\nnearing the limits of this simple layman's ability to comprehend, and I\nwould appreciate an explanation). \n\nI might add, the worldview of \"Things that exist do, and things that\ndon't...don't\" is as grounded in the realm of the non-falsifiable,\nas does the theist's belief in God.  It is based on the assumption\nthat there is *not* a reason for being, something as ultimately\n(un)supportable as the position of there being a reason.  Its very\nfoundation exists in the same soil as that of one who claims there *is* a\nreason.\n\nWe come to this. Either \"I am, therefore I am.\", or \"I am for a reason.\"\nIf the former is a satisfactory answer, then you are done, for you are\nsatisfied, and need not a doctor.  If the latter, your search is just\nbeginning.  \n\n= I seriously doubt God could have an answer to this question.\n\nTime will tell. 8^)\n\n= \n= Some Christians I have talked to have said that actually, God is\n= Himself the existence. However, I see several problems with this\n= answer. First, it inevitably leads to the conclusion that God is\n= actually _all_ existence, good and evil, devils and angels, us and\n= them. This is pantheism, not Christianity.\n\nAgreed.  It would lead me to question their definition of Christianity as\nwell.\n\n= Another answer is that God is the _source_ of all existence.\n= This sounds much better, but I am tempted to ask: Does God\n= Himself exist, then? If God is the source of His own existence,\n= it can only mean that He has, in terms of human time, always\n= existed. But this is not the same as the source of all existence.\n\nThis does not preclude His existence.  It only seeks to identify His\n*qualities* (implying He exists to *have* qualities, BTW).\n\n= The best answer I have heard is that human reasoning is incapable\n= of understanding such questions. Being an atheist myself, I do not\n= accept such answers, since I do not have any other methods.\n\nLike the theist, we come to a statement of faith, for this position assumes \nthat the evidence at hand is conclusive.  Note, I am not arguing against \nscientific endeavor, for science is useful for understanding the universe in\nwhich we exist. But I differ from the atheist in a matter of perspective.  I\nseek to understand what exists to understand and appreciate the art of the\nCreator.\n\nI also have discovered science is an inadequate tool to answer \"why\".   It\nappears that M. Pihko agrees (as we shall see).  But because a tool is\ninadequate to answer a question does not preclude the question.  Asserting\nthat 'why' is an invalid question does not provide an answer.  \n\n= : As far as I can tell, the very laws of nature demand a \"why\".  That isn't\n= : true of something outside of nature (i.e., *super*natural).\n= \n= This is not true. Science is a collection of models telling us \"how\",\n= not why, something happens. I cannot see any good reason why the \"why\"\n= questions would be bound only to natural things, assuming that the\n= supernatural domain exists. If supernatural beings exist, it is\n= as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist.\n\nMy apologies.  I was using why as \"why did this come to be\".  Why did\npre-existence become existence.  Why did pre-spacetime become spacetime.\n\nBut we come to the admission that science fails to answer \"Why?\".  Because\nit can't be answered in the realm of modern science, does that make the\nquestion invalid?\n= : I don't believe *any*\n= : technology would be able to produce that necessary *spark* of life, despite\n= : having all of the parts available. Just my opinion.\n= \n= This opinion is also called vitalism; namely, that living systems are\n= somehow _fundamentally_ different from inanimate systems. Do Christians\n= in general adopt this position? What would happen when scientists announce\n= they have created primitive life (say, small bacteria) in a lab?\n\nI suppose we would do the same thing as when Galileo or Capernicus was \n*vindicated*  (before someone starts jumping up and down screaming\n\"Inquisition!\", note I said *vindicated*.  I certainly hope we've gotten\nbeyond the \"shooting the messenger\" stage).\n\nM. Pihko does present a good point though.  We may need to ask \"What do I \nas an individual Christian base my faith on?\"  Will it be shaken by the\nproduction of evidence that shatters our \"sacred cows\" or will we seek to\nunderstand if a new discovery truly disagrees with what God *said* (and\ncontinues to say) in his Word?\n\n\"Why do I ask why?\" (apologies to Budweiser and company 8^]).\n\nJason.\n\n\n\n-- \nJason D.

I think your question should be rephrased. The many\nverses of the Bible which condem homosexuality (by our beliefs) have been\nshoved down the throats of homosexuals for a long time by (well-meaning?)\nChristians. The question is how do they interpret these verses. Any discussion\nof any issue (this or any other issue) requires a proof of your case as well\nas a disproof of the opposing view. We are already familiar with those verses\nand many have proven to themselves that these condem homosexual behaviour.

The question as to whether the Roman canon is not older\neven than that of De Sacramentis is discussed by\nliturgiologists.  Mgr. Batiffol is of this opinion, but we, on\nthe contrary, think that the former bears traces of closer\ncomposition, of a more carefully guarded orthodoxy, and that\nconsequently it is a text corrected from De Sacramentis. We\nshall see, in studying the list of names in the Memento of the\nliving and that of the dead, that Mgr. Batiffol argues with good\nreason that he can date these fragments from the pontificate of\nSymmachus (498-514). We thus have the state of the Roman Mass,\nor at least of the chief parts of the canon, at the beginning of\nthe fourth century.\n"

Is it prophetic?\n3. Is it authentic?\n4. Is it dynamic?\n5. Is it received, collected, read and used?\n\nOn these counts, the apocrapha falls short of the glory of God.\nTo quote Unger's Bible Dictionary on the Apocrapha:\n1. They abound in historical and geographical inaccuracies and\nanachronisms.\n2. They teach doctrines which are false and foster practices\nwhich are at variance with sacred Scripture.\n3. They resort to literary types and display an artificiality of\nsubject matter and styling out of keeping with sacred Scripture.\n4. They lack the distinctive elements which give genuine\nScripture their divine character, such as prophetic power and\npoetic and religious feeling.\n\n>:  \n>:  My interim conclusion is that Protestant exclusion of \n>:  (at least one of) these writings is one of those 'traditions\n>:  of men' one hears of so often.

The Jewish council you mentioned previously didn't\naccept them, so the reformation protestants had good historical\nprecedence for their actions. Jerome only translated the\napocrapha under protest, and it was literally 'over his dead\nbody' that it was included in the catholic canon.\n\n>The simple fact is that Protestant exclusion, Roman inclusion, Orthodox\n>inclusion of still other books, or any other definition of a closed canon\n>is the decision of a community of faith about what the standard collection\n>of scripture shall be for that community.

I personally believe that the concept of a closed canon, whether\n>Catholic, Protestant, or Orthodox is one that developed rather late in the\n>history of the church, and which has not served the church well.\n\nHow do you then view the words: \"I warn everyone who  hears the\nwords of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds anything to\nthem, God will add to him the plagues described in this book.\nAnd if anyone takes away from this book the prophecy, God will\ntake away from him his share in the tree of life and in the\nholy city\" (Rev 22.18-9)\nSurely this sets the standard and not just man-made traditions.\n\nIt is also noteworthy to consider Jesus' attitude. He had no\nargument with the pharisees over any of the OT canon (John\n10.31-6), and explained to his followers on the road to Emmaus \nthat in the law, prophets and psalms which referred to him - the \nOT division of Scripture (Luke 24.44), as well as in Luke 11.51\ntaking Genesis to Chronicles (the jewish order - we would say\nGenesis to Malachi) as Scripture.\n\n>See Dr. Lee MacDonald's _The Formation of the Christian Biblical Canon_\n>(Abingdon, 1988) for a clear and faithful examination of the origins and\n>issues of the canon.\n\nI am not familiar with the book. \nSome other arguments you might like to consider are found in\nChapter 3 of Josh McDowell's Evidence That Demands A Verdict.\n\nBarney Resson\n\"Many shall run to and fro, & knowledge shall increase\" (Daniel)\n"

A.D. 388\n\nThere are many others.\n\n>As the tenets of faith developed, particularly with Augustine, sin was\n>more and more equated with sex, and thus Mary was assumed to be a virgin\n>for life (since she never sinned, and since she was the spouse of God, etc.)\n\nNo.  We have, for instance:\n\n    Was there ever anyone of any breeding who dared to speak the name of\n    Holy Mary, and being questioned, did not immediately add, \"the Virgin\"?\n    ... And to Holy Mary, Virgin is invariably added, for that Holy Woman\n    remains undefiled.\n                -- St. Epiphanus of Salamis, \"Panacea against all heresies\",\n                   between A.D. 374-377.\n\n    We surely cannot deny that you were right in correcting the doctrine\n    about children of Mary ... For the Lord Jesus would not have chosen\n    to be born of a virgin if He had judged that she would be so incontinent\n    as to taint the birthplace of the Body of the Lord, home of the Eternal\n    King, with the seed of human intercourse.  Anyone who proposes this is\n    merely proposing ... that Christ could not be born of a virgin.\n                -- Pope St. Siricius, Letter to Anysius, Bishop of \n                   Thessalonica, A.D. 392\n\nNote that St. Augustine's conversion to Christianity was in A.D. 387.  I\ndon't know offhand when his election as bishop of Hippo was, but I'm quite\nsure it was after 392.  The belief in Mary's perpetual virginity originated\nlong before Augustine's time.  We hold that it originated with the \nApostles.\n\nStrictly speaking, however, Mary's perpetual virginity is independent\nof her Immaculate Conception.  Mary could have been Immaculately \nConceived and not remained a virgin; she could have remained a virgin\nand not been Immaculately Conceived.\n\n>Since we also had this notion of original sin, ie. that man is born with\n>a predisposition to sin, and since Mary did not have this predisposition\n>because she did not ever sin, she didn't have original sin.

Prayerfully reflecting on the\ntruth of Mary's sinlessness, and the means by which God could have\nachieved this, the Church arrived at the truth of the Immaculate\nConception.  Thus, the Immaculate Conception is not a new doctrine,\nbut the logical result of our understanding of two old ones.\n\nThe celebration of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception itself was\ngiven by Pope Sixtus IV (1471-84) and the Feast was made a precept\nfeast of the Church by Pope Clement XI (1700-21).\n\n>Mary at that time appeared to a girl named Bernadette at Lourdes.  She \n>refered to herself as the Immaculate Conception.  Since a nine year old \n>would have no way of knowing about the doctrine, the apparition was deemed\n>to be true and it sealed the case for the doctrine.\n\nNo.  First of all, Lourdes is private revelation, and doctrine is not\nbased on private revelation.  The most that private revelation can do\nis enhance and deepen our understanding of existing public revelation,\nwhich ended with the death of St. John the Apostle.\n\nSecond, the \"case for the doctrine\" was irreformably sealed in 1854 \nwith the ex cathedra promulgation of the Bull \"Ineffabilis Deus\" by\nPope Pius IX.  This meant that the doctrine was formally recognized as\na dogma; a dogma, by definition, cannot change and is required to be\nbelieved by the faithful.\n\nThe apparition at Lourdes happened in 1858, four years later.  The most\nthat might be claimed is that Lourdes gave the infallible proclamation\nof 1854 a sort of heavenly stamp of approval, but the Church has never\nclaimed that, nor shall she.\n\nIn Christ's Peace,\n\nBrad Kaiser\n(bradk@isdgsm.eurpd.csg.mot.com)\n\n\t  Those who trust in Him shall understand truth,\n\t  and the faithful shall abide with Him in love;\n\t  Because grace and mercy are with His holy ones,\n\t  and His care is with His elect.\n\t\t    -- Wis 3:9 [NAB]\n"

Please don't talk about Jesus' \"parents\"--the doctrinal positions\n\t\tof the church an unequivocally different regarding Mary and\n\t\tJoseph.  I (personally) have never heard of anything being\n\t\tattributed to St. Joseph other than his sainthood; that is,\n\t\tno reference *ever* to him being sinless, assumed into heaven,\n\t\timmaculately conceived, etc.--all these ideas apply only to\n\t\tMary.\n\n\t2.  I would agree there is very little scriptural evidence for our\n\t\tdoctrines about Mary.  Needless to say, that presents a \n\t\tsignificant problem to those who accept the bible as the only\n\t\tsource of doctrine.  If, however, one turns to the sacred \n\t\ttraditions of the undivided Christian Church, there is no\n\t\tproblem finding plently of evidence that it was basically a\n\t\tunanimous belief among the apostles and all the early \n\t\tgeneration that Mary was assumed into heaven, body and soul,\n\t\tetc. etc.  It wasn't until the reformation that these doctrines\n\t\twere called into question.  As far as I am concerned (again, my\n\t\tpersonaly feelings) if it's a choice between the apostles or\n\t\tLuther, I'll choose the apostles every time, whether or not\n\t\tit is recorded within the writings that the traditions of men\n\t\thave determined to be \"the bible\".\n\n\tLike a said, just a couple of notes.  As is often said, I believe that\nwe must agree to (politely) disagree.  \n\tMay God's peace and blessings be with you always in your search to\ndiscover His absolute truth.  \n\t\t\t- Mike Walker\n\t\t\t  mdw33310@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu\n\t\t\t  (Univ. of Illinois)\n"

He defines sexuality by behavior, not by \n> orientation, and ranked all persons on a scale from Zero (completely \n> heterosexual) to 6 (completely heterosexual).\n\nIt seems one or the other end of the rating scale should be identified with \n\"homosexual\".\n\nAs a personal note, I guess I differ with you on the question of work \nentering human life as a result of sin.  \n> Note that in the \n> creation story work enters human life as a result of sin.\n \nBefore the fall (Gen 2:15) \"And the LORD God took the man, and put him into \nthe garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.\" which I would call \"work\".  \nFor me, the difference introduced by sin is the painful aspects of work added \nat the fall (I take the cursing of the ground in vs.17-19 to apply to the \nwork for sustenance).  In a way, some view \"work\" as a blessing (Ecclesiastes \nis a fun book! - for melancholies).\n\nI hope I do not sound caustic, maybe you can enlighten me further.\n\nWell, this is certainly a delicate subject, and I guess you accomplished what \nyou state as your purpose \"It summarizes arguments for allowing Christian \nhomosexuality\", not for me the most noble goal, but you are writing a FAQ.\n\nI wonder if you might temporize the apparent \"sentence\" of the specific \nhomosexual you propose (arguably tenuously define).\n> The danger in advising Christians to\n> depend upon such a change is clear: When \"conversion\" doesn't happen,\n> which is almost always, the people are often left in despair, feeling\n> excluded from a Church that has nothing more to say but a requirement\n> of life-long celibacy. \n  Perhaps that would be true of \"celibacy from homosexual relations\", or \nrefrainng from their choice relationships, but that does not forbid \nheterosexual.  Could they not have/enjoy heterosexual relations \"for what it \nwas worth\"?\n \n[This depends upon the person.  In some cases I think the answer is\nno.  Even with those who could, consider what you're asking.  I assume\nwe're talking about marriage -- I certainly would not want to suggest\nsex outside that.  You're talking about a permanent commitment to a\nkind of sexual relationship that they aren't really sure they can live\nwith.  There may be people for whom this is a possible solution, but I\nwonder whether it's entirely fair to the other partner.  I have a\ncousin who was a victim of exactly this situation.  We found out later\n(after her death) that her husband had had problems with his sexual\nidentity.  His family (conservative Christians) knew it, and pushed\nhim into getting married.  He continued having problems, and they were\nnear divorce.  She died in an accident whose circumstances some of the\nrelatives consider odd.  He has since had a sex change operation, and\nhas been moving around from state to state without being able to hold\na job, keeping their children in a kind of home life both sets of\ngrandparents consider irresponsible.  I hope you can understand why I\nam not enthusiastic about pushing homosexuals into marriage.  I really\nliked my cousin.  This is sort of an emotional issue for me.  Again,\nit may be possible for some, but this is the sort of situation that\nneeds to be dealt with pastorally and not as a matter of fixed\nideology.  --clh]\n"

Some restrict the term's meaning to \"active male\nprostititute,\" but stronger evidence supports a more general translation,\nnamely \"homosexuals.\"  More recently the definition \"homosexual\" has been\nopposed on clutural and linguistic grounds, the claim being that the term\n\"homosexuals\" is anachronistic.  In addition, criticism of the traditional\nrendering says the term today includes celibate homophiles, excludes\nheterosexuals who engage in homosexual acts, and includes female homosexuals. \nA concern for acts instead of the modern attention to desires was the only\nfactor in the ancient world.  The foregoing oppositition to the translation of\narsenokoitai by \"homosexuals\" has a number of debilitating weaknesses. \nFinally, this study argues that Paul coined the term arsenokoitai, deriving it\nfrom the LXX of Lev 20:12 (cf. 18:22) and using it for homosexual orientation\nand behavior, the latter of which should be an occasion for church discipline\n(I Cor 5-6) and legislation in society (1 Tim 1:8-11).\n\n                      *************************************\n\n                                   INTRODUCTION\n\n     Coincident with the rise of the gay rights movement in recent years has\nbeen an increasing focus on the biblical statements regarding homosexuality or\nsodomy.    As part of this focus, the meaning of the term arsenokoitai, used\ntwice by the apostle Paul (1 Cor 6:9,  I Tim 1:10), has received vigorous\nscrutiny.    This issue is particularly crucial to contemporary society since\nso much of modern ethics is shaped by biblical statements.  More particularly, \nthe concern over gay rights and the place of gays or homosexuals in the church\nand in society require the resolution of biblical interpretation.\n\n     This study of historical, linguistic, and literary matters will survey and\nevalutate recent proposals for the meaning of arsenokoitai and present evidence\nto point to a resolution.  Several writers and their positions represent the\nmodern debate on this word.  Three authors, Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs, have\nprovoked considerable discussion and significantly encouraged the wider\nacceptance of the homosexual lifestyle in society, in the church, and in the\nministry. \n\n\nFootnotes:\n_______________________\n 1.  For convenience sake, the term \"homosexual\" is used to encompass both\nsame-sex orientation and same-sex behavior.  The meaning of this term is one of\nthe main considerations of this study.\n 2. These times are differnt from just over a century ago.  Then P Fairbairn\n(Pastoral Epistles [Edinburg, 1874)  891) could write of arsenokoitai thit it\nis a \"term for which fortunately our language has no proper equivalent.\" \nUnknowingly he thereby touched upon the basis for the contemporary debate and\nstudy.  THe present writer endorses the Pauline authorship of the Pastoral\nEpistles on the basis of internal and external evidence (see Donald Guthrie,\nNew Testament Introduction, [4th ed;  1990] 621-649, for an extensive\ndiscussion and citation of supporters of the Pauline authorship).\n 3. For example, see Scroggs' influence on M. Olson, \"Untangling the Web,\" The\nOther Side (April 1984): 24-29.  For a study suggesting a further prohibition\nof homosexuality in the OT, see A. Phillips, \"Unconvering the Father's Skirt,\"\nVT 30/1 (Jan, 1980) 38-43.  For a bibliography of other sources dealing with\narsenokoitai, see the Wisondisc Religion Indexes (NY: H. Wison Co., 1987).\n"

Buehler)\nSubject: Re: Baptism requires Faith\n\n(Aaron Bryce Cardenas) writes:\n\n   Romans 10:16-17 \"But not all the Israelites accepted the good news.  For\n   Isaiah says, 'Lord, who has believed our message?'  Consequently, faith\n   comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word\n   of Christ.\"\n\n   So then we receive God's gift of faith to us as we hear the message of the\n   gospel.  Faith is a possible response to hearing God's word preached.  Kids\n   are not yet spiritually, intellectually, or emotionally mature enough to\n   respond to God's word.  Hence they cannot have faith and therefore cannot\n   be raised in baptism to a new life.\n\nCatholics view the effects of Baptism slightly differently, and that's\none primary reason why they baptize babies.  They believe that Baptism\nproduces a change in the soul of the baby, quite independently of any\nvolitional act on the part of the baby.  This change in the baby's\nsoul gives the infant certain capabilities that he would not have\nwithout Baptism.  Since the infant does not have the use of his\nintellect and will yet, these new faculties are dormant.  But as the\nchild gets older, the gifts of Baptism come more and more into play.\n\n   Ezekiel 18:20 \"The soul who sins will die.  The son will not share the\n   guilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the son.  The\n   righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him, and the\n   wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him.\"\n\n   If you read all of Ezekiel 18, you will see that God doesn't hold us guilty\n   for anyone else's sins.  So we can have no original guilt from Adam.\n\nAdam was given a number of gifts by God.  The chief among them was\nwhat Catholics call \"sanctifying grace\".  (In the New Testament, the\nword used for this is \"charity\".)  By his sin, Adam lost this grace.\nHe didn't lose it just for himself, however, he lost it for the whole\nhuman race.  Because once he lost it, he couldn't pass it on to his\ndescendents.\n\nThat's why Catholics baptize babies.  Through his Original Sin, Adam\nlost sanctifying grace for all his descendents.  Christ instituted\nBaptism to give it back to everyone.\n\nBabies are not being punished for anything they personally did; they\nare simply lacking in something they need, in order to enter Heaven.\n"

It\nwas a pleasure to read them.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nYou are welcome, Zane.\n \nZane...\n\"I am sure nothing that I will say will change your mind about it... but I\nwould like to ask you if the book in question really does anything for you.\nI mean, were you all caught up in the word/faith thing, but now that you\nhave read the book you've been rescued from all of the error and pain that\nwill result in your Christian life?\"\n \nMY REPLY...\n(1) When I first became a Christian, I entered into the Word/Faith\n    movement.  It was easy.  I wasn't grounded in the Word of God and sound\n    doctrine.  When I visited Christian book stores, the cheapest books I\n    could find to buy were the .50 and $1.00 books by Hagin and others.\n    Consequently, I began receiving Hagin's monthly magazine (and they\n    still send it to me), and also Copeland's (also, still sent to me).\n    It wasn't until I read a booklet by Jimmy Swaggart called _Hyper Faith:\n    The New Gnosticism_ that I began to realize the teachings I were\n    partaking of were error.  I started reading the Bible more and studying\n    more.  Sure enough, Jimmy was right in many points.  As part of my\n    experience, I am alerting Christians, particularly new Christians, that\n    these teachings are heretical and they need to do as the Bereans did in\n    Acts 17:11 - check these teachings out with Scripture!\n \n(2) My brother in law was involved in a Word/Faith \"cult\" in my area - it's\n    leader is real good friends with Benny Hinn.  Rather then going into\n    much detail about this, suffice it to say he was deceived, mistreated, and\n    has now fallen into atheism.  I'm still praying for him (Phil. 1:6).\n \n(3) The assistant pastor at the church I teach adult Sunday School in has been\n    a `follower' of Copeland for 15 years.  He has thousands of tapes by the\n    Faith teachers.  In the class recently, I quoted several of the teachers'\n    heretical statements to his surprise.  Since then, I've been able to talk\n    to him at length about these issues.\n \n(4) The leader of the Women's Group at my church is a Benny Hinn `fan'.\n    Recently, I found that she has been lending _Good Morning, Holy Spirit_ to\n    women in the church.  That prompted my quotes in Sunday School, as well as\n    my lending CIC to people in the church.\n \nI'm well aware of the abuses and heresies perpetrated in this movement and\nhave an urgency in my heart and life to warn people about the heresies.\nWhat heresies?\n    A. Jesus became sin - took on the very nature of the devil, and became\n        one with him.\n    B. Jesus' death on the cross wasn't enough to atone.\n    C. Jesus was dragged to hell after His death, was beat and abused by\n        Satan and demons, thus finishing our atonement.  Satan was ruling\n        over Him there.\n    D. Jesus was `born-again' in hell.\n    E. Jesus died spiritually, lost His divinity, and reassumed it after\n        the resurrection.\n    F. We are gods.\n \nThese are heresies.  Documentation will be provided re: these teachings\nupon request.\n \nZane...\n\"Or what does it do for you?  Is it preventing you from going out and\njoining up with the word/faith movement which you'd been contemplating\njoining for so long, but now that you've read the book, you've been saved\nfrom all of that?\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nIt wasn't _Christianity In Crisis_ that helped me; it was a booklet by\nSwaggart that I mentioned above.  But CIC is MUCH, MUCH better - tremendous\ndocumentation and insights.\n \nZane...\n\"I don't have a nice Scriptural answer for why I believe it is at best un-\nprofitable for Christians to engage in this type of activity - heresy hunting.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nWhy do you call it \"heresy hunting\"?  \"Hunting\" implies it isn't readily\naccessible or available.  This movement is the fastest growing movement in\nChristendom.  Hagin has sold over 40 million books and booklets.  Hinn has sold\nmore books in the last couple of years than Swindoll and Dobson combined.  Fred\nPrice has the largest church in terms of seating capacity in the USA.  Doesn't\nsound like much \"hunting\" is needed.\n \nIt is Scriptural to expose doctrinal error.  I gave some verses to you before.\nMore can be given.  Most of the epistles were written due to error (doctrinal,\npractical) in the churches.  The early church had numerous councils to expose\nerror and heresy.  It's not a new thing.  Remember Luther?\n \nZane...\n\"I would like to point out though, that historically those who hunt heretics\noften end up causing a bigger mess than the heretics... but this is my un-\ndocumented opinion.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\n(1) If you can provide documentation, it would be appreciated.\n(2) Read Ephesians 4:11-16, esp. vss. 13 and 14 and tell me what causes\n    disunity and immaturity in the body.\n \nEPH 4:13-14 till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of\nthe Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness\nof Christ; that we should no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carried\nabout with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in the cunning\ncraftiness of deceitful plotting....\n \nDisunity, contrary to popular opinion, isn't caused by exposing error; it's\ncaused by error.\n \nZane...\n\"There are many who probably give no place for seeing the Scriptures as\ndocumenting a Spiritual development or growth in its writers - but I would\nsuggest that the fiery Paul of the letter to the Galatians mellows and\nmatures into the one who loses all for the sake of Love in the End.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nMost scholars believe Paul wrote 2 Timothy last.  Let's examine his admonitions\nto Tim to ascertain how mellow he had become...\n \n2TI 1:13-15 Hold fast the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me,\nin faith and love which are in Christ Jesus. That good thing which was\ncommitted to you, keep by the Holy Spirit who dwells in us. This you know, that\nall those in Asia have turned away from me, among whom are Phygellus and\nHermogenes.\n \n2TI 2:15-18 Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does\nnot need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. But shun profane\nand idle babblings, for they will increase to more ungodliness. And their\nmessage will spread like cancer. Hymenaeus and Philetus are of this sort, who\nhave strayed concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already\npast; and they overthrow the faith of some.\n \n2TI 2:24-26 And a servant of the Lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all,\nable to teach, patient, in humility correcting those who are in opposition, if\nGod perhaps will grant them repentance, so that they may know the truth, and\nthat they may come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil, having\nbeen taken captive by him to do his will.\n \n2TI 3:6-9 For of this sort are those who creep into households and make\ncaptives of gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts,\nalways learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. Now as\nJannes and Jambres resisted Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of\ncorrupt minds, disapproved concerning the faith; but they will progress no\nfurther, for their folly will be manifest to all, as theirs also was.\n \n2TI 3:12-17 Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer\npersecution. But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving\nand being deceived. But you must continue in the things which you have learned\nand been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them, and that from\nchildhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise\nfor salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is given by\ninspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for\ncorrection, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be\ncomplete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.\n \n2TI 4:2-5 Preach the word! Be ready in season and out of season. Convince,\nrebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching. For the time will come\nwhen they will not endure sound doctrine, but according to their own desires,\nbecause they have itching ears, they will heap up for themselves teachers; and\nthey will turn their ears away from the truth, and be turned aside to fables.\nBut you be watchful in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an\nevangelist, fulfill your ministry.\n \n2TI 4:14-15 Alexander the coppersmith did me much harm. May the Lord repay him\naccording to his works. You also must beware of him, for he has greatly\nresisted our words.\n \nZane...\n\"The picture I have of Paul is not of one who goes out of his way to destroy\nthe ministry of wolves... but of one who teaches the sheep, with many tears,\nthe necessity of absolutely not allowing themselves to be transformed into\nwolves to protect themselves.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nACT 20:26-31 \"Therefore I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the\nblood of all men. \"For I have not shunned to declare to you the whole counsel\nof God. \"Therefore take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among which\nthe Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God which He\npurchased with His own blood. \"For I know this, that after my departure savage\nwolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock. \"Also from among\nyourselves men will rise up, speaking perverse things, to draw away the\ndisciples after themselves. \"Therefore watch, and remember that for three years\nI did not cease to warn everyone night and day with tears.\n \nZane...\n\"For all the warning Paul does, it is of note that he never once drops a name\nof a wolf....  - but I will admit he cries in his beard at the end over those\nwho have abandoned him - everyone in Asia wasn't it ?\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nPaul mentioned names...\n \n1TI 1:18-20 This charge I commit to you, son Timothy, according to the\nprophecies previously made concerning you, that by them you may wage the good\nwarfare, having faith and a good conscience, which some having rejected,\nconcerning the faith have suffered shipwreck, of whom are Hymenaeus and\nAlexander, whom I delivered to Satan that they may learn not to blaspheme.\n \n2TI 1:15 This you know, that all those in Asia have turned away from me, among\nwhom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.\n \n2TI 2:16-18 But shun profane and idle babblings, for they will increase to more\nungodliness.

May the Lord repay him\naccording to his works. You also must beware of him, for he has greatly\nresisted our words.\n \nSo did John...\n \n3JO 1:9-10 I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to have the\npreeminence among them, does not receive us. Therefore, if I come, I will call\nto mind his deeds which he does, prating against us with malicious words. And\nnot content with that, he himself does not receive the brethren, and forbids\nthose who wish to, putting them out of the church.\n \nJesus also singled out teachings and doctrines...\n \nREV 2:14-16 \"But I have a few things against you, because you have there those\nwho hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block\nbefore the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit\nsexual immorality. \"Thus you also have those who hold the doctrine of the\nNicolaitans, which thing I hate. 'Repent, or else I will come to you quickly\nand will fight against them with the sword of My mouth.\n \nREV 2:20-23 \"Nevertheless I have a few things against you, because you allow\nthat woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, to teach and seduce My\nservants to commit sexual immorality and eat things sacrificed to idols. \"And I\ngave her time to repent of her sexual immorality, and she did not repent.\n\"Indeed I will cast her into a sickbed, and those who commit adultery with her\ninto great tribulation, unless they repent of their deeds. \"I will kill her\nchildren with death, and all the churches shall know that I am He who searches\nthe minds and hearts. And I will give to each one of you according to your\nworks.\n \nZane...\n\"I question too, the purposes of those who write books and build ministries\non the faults - deliberate or otherwise - of others.  Maybe if they would\nwander around in the desert eating locust and honey, or barely cakes...with\nno worldly goods at stake, money to be made, or no reputations to maintain...\nI would question their motives - conscious or otherwise - less.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nI won't comment on this because it deals with the intangible motives of others.\nBut even if they had bad motives, remember what Paul said...\n \nPHI 1:15-18 Some indeed preach Christ even from envy and strife, and some also\nfrom good will: The former preach Christ from selfish ambition, not sincerely,\nsupposing to add affliction to my chains; but the latter out of love, knowing\nthat I am appointed for the defense of the gospel. What then? Only that in\nevery way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is preached; and in this I\nrejoice, yes, and will rejoice.\n \nZane...\n\"If we want to be true to the admonitions of Scripture - many of which you\nlist - about protecting ourselves and the flock from wolves and winds of\ndoctrines, I suggest we start by allowing the wolf-program in our own noetic\npasture to be nailed to the Cross.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nPlease explain.\n \nZane...\n\"Secondly, I suggest any heresy hunting be restricted to our own fellowships -\nwhich in the strict Scriptural sense is the local city-church.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nIf heresy was not being propagated over the mass media, then it may not be\nneeded to go mass media with the exposure.  Unfortunately, heresy is being\ntaught not just in Copeland's church or Hagin's or Hinn's or Price's, but all\nover the radio, in print, etc.  No pastor or church leader knows what materials\nthe sheep are feeding on outside the church.  It's imperative that leadership\nbe made aware of this, and CIC does just that.\n \nAlso, let's examine a passage of Scripture...\n* EPH 4:11 And He Himself gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some\nevangelists, and some pastors and teachers,\n* EPH 4:12 for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry, for the\nedifying of the body of Christ,\n \nThese ministry gifts that the Lord installs in the church are not just for one\nindividual church, but for \"the body of Christ\".\nPaul was an apostle - he traveled all over distilling his message.  He was also\na teacher -\n1CO 4:17 For this reason I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and\nfaithful son in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways in Christ, as I teach\neverywhere in every church.\n1CO 7:17 But as God has distributed to each one, as the Lord has called each\none, so let him walk. And so I ordain in all the churches.\n \nAlso -\n1CO 12:28 And God has appointed these in the church: first apostles, second\nprophets, third teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps,\nadministrations, varieties of tongues.\n \n* EPH 4:13 till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of\nthe Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness\nof Christ;\n \nNotice that the \"Five-Fold\" ministries are going to be around \"till\" the church\nis in \"unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God to a perfect\nman\".  This, I believe will not occur fully until the Lord Jesus returns (see\n1Cor. 13:9-12).  But God wants the body to continue on maturing.  What hinders\nmaturity and unity of the body?\n \n* EPH 4:14 that we should no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carried\nabout with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in the cunning\ncraftiness of deceitful plotting,\n \nIt's clear that false doctrine, integrated into the church \"by the trickery of\nmen\" causes (1) disunity [the thing we are striving for] and (2) spiritual\nimmaturity - the church continues in spiritual childhood when Christians are\n\"tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine\".\n \nThe \"Five -Fold\" ministry, of which there does not appear to be clear\nScriptural denominational boundaries (\"pastors\" appear responsible for their\nindividual flock), is to deal with these doctrines (when necessary) in their\nstruggle to equip the body.\n \nAll believers are called to do this to a degree...\nJUD 1:3-4 Beloved, while I was very diligent to write to you concerning our\ncommon salvation, I found it necessary to write to you exhorting you to contend\nearnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints. For\ncertain men have crept in unnoticed, who long ago were marked out for this\ncondemnation, ungodly men, who turn the grace of our God into lewdness and deny\nthe only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ.\n \nZane...\n\"If you'll notice, in Scripture the heresy hunters that went from Church to\nChurch and area to area, were the \"bad guys\" and they went after the \"good guy\"\nnamely Paul - who they considered to be the arch heretic.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nThey were themselves heretics trying to discredit Paul who was preaching\ncontrary to what they taught!\n \nZane...\n\"Let's face it, the wolves are here for a reason.  And we are here for the\nReason.  And let's hope the wolves become sheep, and the sheep, lambs.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nYes!\n2TI 2:24-26 And a servant of the Lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all,\n                                                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nable to teach, patient, in humility correcting those who are in opposition, if\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~\nGod perhaps will grant them repentance, so that they may know the truth, and\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nthat they may come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil, having\nbeen taken captive by him to do his will.\n \nAMEN!\n\n\nFrank\n-- \n\"If one wished to contend with Him, he could not answer Him one time out\n of a thousand.\"  JOB 9:3\n"

Sex, or Christianity?\n\nI'm afraid I see that question as very tendentious.  Try rephrasing it:\n\n\tWhat's more important to Christians?  Love of God or love\n\tof other human beings?\n\nto which of course the only conceivable answer is that the one is like\nthe other.  I am *deeply* suspicious of any \"flavor\" of Christianity\nwhich would elevate one clause of the Great Commandment to a \"priority\"\nover the other such as to claim a conflict.  True, we are told to let\nthe dead bury the dead, to \"hate\" family rather than let it keep us from\nfollowing Christ.  But the dichotomy here is not one between love of our\nfellows and love of God, but of allowing *social* constructs to blind us\nto the presense of God.  It is particularly satanic to twist love of God\nin such a manner as to become an excuse to treat others as on a different\nlevel than the one who is so caught up in \"love\" of God.\n\nThe trouble comes in the relation of human love and human sex.  Yes, it\nhas sometimes been the case that the Church has \"taught\" that all sex\nwas nasty, evil, sinful stuff.  But when man and wife leave their parental\nhomes to become helpmates, living in one flesh, it is the sex that is the\nvehicle of becoming \"one flesh\" (if you doubt me, read St. Paul on what\nis wrong with frequenting prostitutes :-)).  Less provocatively, what I\nmean is just this: sexual bonding is a deeply founded aspect of our social\ninteraction, and in particular is the foundation of the institution of\nmarriage, so that unlike with many mammals, human males remain with and\nfoster the children they beget and support their children's mothers.\nThis is the schema behind Genesis 2:18-24 (and behind Jesus' citation of\nthat passage.)\n\n\t[ I observe, by the way, that not all human males in fact do as\n\t  I have just described; but another thing that characterizes\n\t  human societies is our raising of *non*begotten children, not\n\t  only orphans and adoptees and the like, but products of the\n\t  quite common infidelities of humans to their spouses. We are\n\t  in this not unique in the animal world, but the full extent of\n\t  social consequences and implications is most intricate for us. ]\n\nYes, of course it sometimes goes \"wrong\" -- like all else we do, it is\ninfected with sin, and you find married \"couples\" where there is no bond,\nand people so deliriously addicted to the initial stages of sexual bond\nformation (the \"infatuation\", \"falling in love\" phase) that they break\nany forming bond in order to keep stepping over the threshold of the deep\nunity God has prepared for us, and stepping back out again right away.\nSatan may indeed *use* sex as a very handy tool to corrupt human love --\nbut in the Edenic creation, that is not its nature, and with God's grace\nunder the power of Christ to make all things new it need not be a problem\nfor Christians (though we must be vigilant, even in Christ, as the devil\nis watchful, prowling around like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour.)\n\nSo, returning to the original question, what is more important to STRAIGHT\nChristians?  Sex, or Christianity?  Paul, clearly, tended to think that\nsex was at best a distraction from Christianity (though to be charitable\nto him, his context was in expectation of immediate parousia, so that the\nhard TASKS of a married union -- the lifelong building and adaptation to\neach other -- seemed somehow to undercut the \"proper\" preparation for an\nimmediate eschaton.  Since we *do not* know the hour of return, we should\nact *both* with instant readiness for that *and* with a commitiment to our\nmates that proposes a long lifetime together.  And telling people *not* to\nbond in such a perspective strikes me as crippling us in the second clause\nof the the commandment to love.  I would claim that only a very few saints\nhave the CAPACITY to deeply love (without sexual tinges or complication,\nmind you) their fellow human beings unless they have had a deeply spiritual\nlife in married union growing together as one flesh -- and that means in\nthe type case, with a persistent and continued sexual relationship.  We\nare human, and little good comes of trying to \"mortify the flesh\" to the\npoint of pretending to be otherwise, pretending NOT to be sexual beings.\n\n>Christianity I would hope.  Would they be willing to forgo sex\n>completely, in order to avoid being a stumbling block to others,\n\nIt depends entirely on context.  If that context is major hypocrisy\non the part of those who find us \"stumbling blocks\" I am much less of\na mind to efface myself so that they can pontificate about MY sins.\n\nThere are some people for whom a life of celibacy is a spritual gift,\nand maybe even a victory against a to-them troubling sexual urge that\nseems to them to lead only to sin.  Nothing I say should ever be read\nas demeaning such a gift.  Nor the even rarer gift of love for all our\nconspecifics, and indeed for all God's creation, that can develop to\nthe full *without* the tutoring of a spousal/helpmate marriage founded\nin sex.  But there is a difference between spiritual gifts and penance;\ntelling people that they HAVE to have a particular gift (or else? what?)\nis fraught with manipulation and disregard of the differences of our\nspiritual endowments from God.  To one person is given the gift of\nspeaking in toungues, to another intepretation of toungues; to yet\nanother prophecy; and to still another teaching.  The notion that some\n*particular* gift is required of *all* is one of the earliest heresies.\n-- \nMichael L.

Like I said before, \nI can understand why non-Christians would be denied *access* to holy \nceremonies, but the ceremony itself (communion) was not secret.  In fact, all \nfour gospels record the first \"breaking of the bread\" in some detail.  \nCommunion was a fellowship meal, and it was (and still should be, in my \nopinion) inappropriate to invite those who did not share in the fellowship of \nthe Body of Christ.  The fact that unbelievers, denied access to these communal \nmeals, began to imagine all sorts of secret and debased rituals during \ncommunion does not by any means imply that the early Christians were in fact \nhiding shameful things from the general public.  In fact, I think if you read \nsome of the early church fathers, you will find that they were not at all \nbashful about describing what went on during communion.  That's why it seems \nfunny to me when Mormons, who claim to be the only true restoration of 1st \ncentury Christianity, insist on hiding certain rituals on the grounds that they \nare \"too sacred.\"\n\n- Mark\n\n[Actually, that's not quite the case.  John omits the central elements\nof the Last Supper.  His Gospel is full of symbolism of bread and\nwine.  But the actual story isn't there.  Some people think he has\nomitted some of the details because they were not talked about in\npublic in his community.  There is also evidence that some aspects of\nbaptismal practice were kept secret. See Morton Smith's \"Secret\nGospel\" -- I don't agree with his lurid speculations on what the\nsecret practices actually were, but there does seem to be some\nevidence that Mark omitted certain details because they were \ninappropriate for publication.  --clh]\n"

The reasoning was that congregations\nare free to call whoever they wish, and that Ministers and Sessions\nchoose elders.  If a congregation did not wish to have a woman, they\nwere not obliged to, and if a Session did not wish to, they could not\nbe forced to.  (Note that the who issue of freedom to call on the part\nof the Congregation is VERY important here - this year is the 150th\nAnnivarsary of the Disruption, where the church split on that very\nissue, they didn't get back together for almost 80 years).\n\nA couple of years ago on the 25 anniversary of the allowing of womens\nordination the position was changed - so that, in theory, all\nministers and elders must recognise that women can be ordained.  In\ntheory, a minister who refused to ordain a woman to his Session, or\nrefused to work with a woman minister in Presbytery, could be\ndisciplined.  In practice this has not happened, and I believe it is\nunlikely to happen.  My personal view is that the new legislation was\na mistake, and that the permissive (but not prescriptive) legislation\nworked very well.  \n\nWe are going to start going round the homosexual debate at next years\nassembly.  At this years, a motion was put to ban the blessing of\nsame-sex couples (after an Edinburgh minister did so).

The time scale\nand the homogeneous culture are important.  Equally important is a\nbasic philosophical difference in personal versus collective good.\nIn America, the individual is more important than the masses.  Personal\nliberties are prized above all.  This is, sadly, changing of late, but\nI trust you notice how this call for freedom makes laws that restrict\nindividuals for little collective benefit hateful to Americans.  I'd\nhazard a guess that, were America less interested in freedom and\npersonal liberty and more interested in collective good we never would\nhave sent our armed forces anywhere.  One poor effect of this culture\nwe have is that we're looking out for ourselves and it is quite easy\nto identify with only a small segment of the population.  My grandmother\ntells of being discriminated against back in Denmark because she spoke\n\"low Dane,\" whereas others spoke \"high Dane.\"  It was shortly after\nWorld War II, as I remember, that \"low Dane\" was abolished so there was\none common dialect.

You still haven't offered\n\nI've been watching this knife verses gun bit for a while now, (even\ncontributed a few comments) but this stuff \"I'd rather face a knife than\na gun\" has GOT to come from ignorance!  I used to think pretty much the\nsame thing, then I got 'educated.'\n\nPeople do not as a rule understand how deadly knives can be, or how\nquickly you can be killed with one.  Most people don't understand that\nit takes less than an inch of penetration in some areas to cause quick\n(within a minute or so) death.\n\nThe death rates from handguns and knives are within a few percentage\npoints of each other.  Many people not realizing how deadly knives are\n'try their luck' and thus more get injured by knives.  A gun is deadly\nonly in a single direction and it's only advantage is that it is a\nremote control weapon.  A contact weapon such as a knife controls a\nspherical area 7 to 10 feet in diameter.\n\nMost people have never seen knife wounds, aside from slicing a finger by\naccident.  From 21 feet or so, a knife is very nearly an even match for\na holstered gun in experienced hands, even if the knife wielder has only\nmoderate skill.  From inside 10 feet or so, a knife is a match for a\nDRAWN gun.  A knife is utterly silent, it never jams and never runs out\nof ammunition.  It is limited only by the speed, dexterity skill and\nability of it's wielder.  Criminals in general are young, fast and\nstrong.  It's interesting to note that the patterned slashing attacks\nused by many martial artists remarkably resemble the wild uncontrolled\nslashing attacks of novices.  I've talked to several well trained\nmartial artists.  They have unanimously agreed that if they ever go up\nagainst a knife they simply plan on being cut, hopefully not as bad as\nthe attacker.\n\nPracticing with firearms requires facilities and equipment.  Practicing\nwith knives requires only a small area and something to simulate a\nknife, say a popsicle stick or tooth brush.  Criminals practice their\nknife attacks in prison.\n\nIf you have not trained against knives with a firearm and do not realize\nthese facts the first inkling you will have that something is wrong is\nthe knife ripping through your throat, or in the case of an experienced\nattacker, parts of your body falling off onto the ground.  A 60 year old\nman with arthritis can close that 7 yard distance and gut you in about\none and a half seconds.  Dennis Tueller with a broken leg in a walking\ncast managed it in two.  I've seen people close that distance and strike\nin 1 second.  I'm old, over weight and slow.  I can do it in 1.3\nseconds.  I've seen morgue footage of people killed with edged weapons\nthat you would not believe.  (How about a single stab wound to the chest\nwith a TABLE FORK!  In this case the attacker used the HANDLE, not the\npointed end.)\n\nAdd to this the 'fact' that hand gun 'stopping' power is largely a myth.\nExcept in the case of a central nervous system shot, or a round that\ndestroys the skeletal structure, it takes anywhere from 3 to twelve\nseconds for a bullet wound to 'take effect.'\n\nThis is true of even heart shots.  There is the case of the police woman\nin L.A., the first recorded survivor of a .357 shot to the heart.  That\nlady not only killed her attacker, but chased him down to do it!  All\nfour of her shots, fired after SHE had been shot, struck the perp.  Atta\ngirl!  The bullet entered her on a downward angle, went through the apex\nof her heart, down through the diaphragm, clipped her liver and\ndestroyed her spleen.  It then exited her back leaving a tennis ball\nsized hole.  She died about six times on the operating table, but was\nout of the hospital in 15 days and was back on full duty in eight\nmonths!  She was off duty at the time and not wearing her vest.  She was\non her way home so happened to have her gun.  No, she doesn't think\ncivilians should have the same rights.  Sigh.\n\nThe moral of the story is that even if you DO manage to shoot a knife\nattacker, you'd better be planning on doing some dodging.  A good\nalternative is to shoot for and break the pelvis.  People can often walk\n(a little) on broken legs but a broken pelvis will nearly always anchor\nthem.  Many firearms schools recommend pelvis shots against contact\nweapons.  The target is as large as the traditional 'center of mass' and\nis more reliable to STOP somebody with a contact weapon, assuming a\ncaliber powerful enough to 'do the job.'  Hot .38's on up will usually\ndo this.\n\nRemember folks, the idea isn't to 'take em with you' but for you to live\nand them to fail, whatever the consequences for them.  This the reason\n'killing them' isn't our goal, or in many cases even good enough to keep\nus alive.\n\nI don't want to face a violent attack of any sort.  Knowing what I now\nknow, I can't rightly say I'd rather face a knife than an gun.  It would\nhave to depend on the attacker, and if I could pick and choose, I\nWOULDN'T BE THERE.  This is really the bottom line.  Criminals do not\nfear the law.  Criminals do not fear the weapon.  They fear the citizen\nbehind the weapon that has shown the resolution and determination to do\nwhatever it takes.\n\nRick.\n"

(If you thought lethal\nforce was necessary, you wouldn't be using rubber bullets, would you?)

Spence moved for a mistrial but was denied.\n\nThe day was marked by a caustic cross-examination of Deputy\nMarshal Larry Cooper by defense attorney Gerry Spence.  Although\nSpence has not explicitly stated so, one angle of his stategy\nmust involve destroying the credibility of agent Cooper.  Cooper is\nthe government's only eyewitness to the death of agent Degan.\nSpence attacked Cooper's credibility by pointing out discrepancies\nbetween Cooper's statements last September and those made in court.\nCooper conceded that, \"You have all these things compressed into\na few seconds...It's difficult to remember what went on first.\"\n\nCooper acknowledged that he carried a \"9mm Colt Commando submachine\ngun with a silenced barrel.\" [I thought a Colt Commando was a revolver!]\nCooper continued by stating that the federal agents had no specific\nplans to use the weapon when they started to kill Weaver's dog.\n\nWhen Spence asked how seven cartridges could be fired by Degan's\nM-16 rifle when Degan was apparently dead, Cooper could not say for\nsure that Degan did not return fire before going down.\n\nSpence continued by asking with how many agents (and to what extent)\nhad Cooper discussed last August's events, Cooper responded, \"If\nyou're implying that we got our story together, you're wrong,\ncounselor.\"  Spence continued to advance the defense's version of\nthe events: Namely, that a marshal had started the shooting by\nkilling the Weaver's dog.  Cooper disagreed.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Howen repeatedly objected to Spence's\nvirulent cross-examination of agent Cooper, arguing that the questions\nwere repetitive and Spence was wasting time.  Howen also complained \nthat Spence was improperly using a cross-examination to advance the\ndefense's version of the events.  U.S. District Judge Edward Lodge\nsustained many of the objections; however, both lawyers persisted\nuntil Judge Lodge had the jury leave the room and proceded to\nadmonish both attorneys.  \"I'm not going to play games with either\ncounsel.  This has been a personality problem from day 1, so start\nacting like professionals.\"\n\nSpence told the judge that, \"When all the evidence is in, we'll see\nthat ... his [agent Larry Cooper] testimony is not credible, that\nhe was panicked and cannot remember the sequence of events.\" \nSpence continued, \"We're going to find...that there is a very unlikely\nsimilarity - almost as if it had come out of a cookie cutter - between\nthe testimony of Mr. Cooper and the other witnesses.\"\n\nSpence then moved for a mistrial on the grounds that Howen's repeated\nobjections would prevent a fair trial, \"We can't have a fair trial if the\njury believes I'm some sort of charlatan, if the jury believes I'm\nbending the rules or engaging in some delaying tactic or that I'm\nviolating court orders.\"\n\nJudge Lodge called the notion that his repeated sustainings of Howen's\nobjections had somehow prejudiced the jury was \"preposterous\" and\ndenied the motion for a mistrial.  Lodge did tell Howen to restrict\nhis comments when objecting.\n\nThe trial resumed with the prosecution calling FBI Special Agent Greg\nRampton.  The prosecution's purpose was simply to introduce five\nweapons found in the cabin as evidence: However, the defense seized\non the opportunity to further address Cooper's credibility.\n\nDefense attorney Ellison Matthews (Harris' other attorney) questioned\nRampton about the dog.  Rampton stated that there were no specific\nplans to kill the Weaver's dog without being detected.  Matthews then\nhad Rampton read  a Septtember 15, 1992 transcript in which Rampton\nhad said that Cooper had said that the purpose of the silenced weapon\nwas to kill the dog without being detected, if the dog chased them.\nRampton then acknowledged that he believed that Cooper had said that,\nbut he could not remember when.  He then stated that, \"I did not conduct\nthe primary interview with Deputy Cooper, but I have had conversations\nwith him since the interview was conducted.\"\n\nMonday, April 19, 1993 will begin the fifth day of the trial.  Scheduled\nis the continued cross-examination of FBI agent Greg Rampton.\n\n\n"

My point was at\nwhat distance, or level of threat, we draw the line.  Is it the\nendangerment of others, so we do a 5' restriction, or the possibility\nof being shot, hence we draw a 1.5 mile restriction, or a nuke and\ndraw a 5 mile restriction?  To me they al suffer from the fundamental\nflaw that they restrict based upon the instrument rather than placing\nthe responsibility for usage squarely upon the shoulders of the user.\nPerhaps Sen. Metzenbaum declaring the Barrett Light Fifty an assault\nrifle has made this more apparent to me, since the Barrett has\nonly range and acurracy going for it.\n\n>They have determined that their lives are worth the effort to\n>protect their homes and families.

I assume that word\nwould get to the citizens that such an attack was planned.  If this\nis not the case, the tactical and strategic implications change\nquite a bit.  Personally, my home is worth, say, twenty Martians\nintent on taking over the world.  My family?  All of them.

Furthermore, it is even more doubtful their training\nincludes proper tactical movements that best utilize tanks,\nwhereas the commonly rifleman is not so hampered in effectiveness.\n\n>I think it is vital to avoid such a situation, where a small \n>minority would have a reasonable chance of gaining political power\n>through violence.

Since the expense of a tank is so large,\nthough, chances are it would be jointly purchased and should\ntherefore be jointly maintained and operated.\n\n>Here, I think we have to be carefull about _which_ \"state\" we\n>are talking about: Certainly one role of the militia is to\n>overthrow a repressive government, and it would be completely\n>destructive to that end for that same government to control \n>the militia's arms.

The State having control\nover the heavy weapons should not be justification for the state\nto have them centrally located.  Keep them spread out, such that\nthe ability of the State to lock them up isn't so easy.  Otherwise,\nI would have to assume that State control would rest on the\nauthority of the Governor and militia officers.\n\n>That is eaxctly why I think they should be removed: The select\n>militia should privide the militia's heavy weapons and highly-trained\n>specialists.

Just as you argued above that\nthe weapons should be divvied up and under democratic control\nso one side doesn't have all of them, I can't see where this\nsituation is alleviated in having the select militia holding\nall the weapons and the unorganized militia being the infantry.\nI think a better mix is called for.  But, I would argue that\nthe Federal army should rely upon the select militia and the\nunorganized militia for the bulk of its infantry units.\n\n>Consider, then, the effect of removing the National Guard's\n>infantry and placing the Guard under the control of local\n>governments.

These would be much more useful to infantry than the\ntank would be when cost and training requirements are figured in.\nI suppose I'm quibbling over what constitutes heavy equipment.\n\n>>...but a mechanized infantry unit is what builds\n>>dikes in times of flood, sets up disaster relief cities, and\n>>the like.\n>\n>I would much rather see these things handled by the local, \n>general militias.\n\n\tSo would I, but the resources often aren't available to\noutfit local units well enough.  Thus, we will certainly have to\ncall in others, and a mechanized unit carries more stuff faster\nthan anything else.\n\n>Perhaps the National Guard isn't as close to my conception of\n>the select militia as I thought: I was considering them to \n>be the heavy weapons/armor arm of the militia, not the infantry\n>arm of the regular army.\n\n\tPerhaps our ideas of heavy weapons are different?  I think\nmain battle tanks, self-propelled artillery, and 155mm and up\nfield pieces are heavy stuff.  M113 troop carriers, 2 1/2 ton\ntrucks, HumVee's, old M60 tanks, 105 Howitzers, are more the stuff\nof a mechanized infantry.  Actually, this is what the Guard units\nin Iowa are currently fielding in some units.\n\n\tPerhaps it is just my innate fear of having the real heavy\nequipment under State control, with little but numbers and light\nstuff to act as a deterrent.  Allowing main battle tanks to the\nstates should be balanced with anti-tank capability in the local\nranks.  Similarly, local units would need to band together quickly,\nhence small and fast response means mechanized infantry.  Finally,\nthe militia is more than just fighting.  Equipment is needed for\nother responses.  The Federal army, I'm convinced, should have a\nvery minumum of infantry, relying on the state and local militias\nfor these functions.\n\n< Dan Sorenson, DoD #1066 z1dan@exnet.iastate.edu viking@iastate.edu >\n<  ISU only censors what I read, not what I say.

U.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge\nasks jurors not to hear accounts of the Waco fire because\nof possible influences on the Weaver/Harris case.\n\nThe testimony of FBI Special Agent Greg Rampton apparently\nended without further incident, as it was mentioned neither\nby KTVB nor the _Idaho Statesman_.\n\nThe day was highlighted by the testimony of Kenneth Fadeley,\nwho had been posing as an outlaw biker and illegal guns person\nnamed Gus Magiosono.  Fadeley testified that he was acting as\nan informant for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms\nin his dealings with Randy Weaver.\n\nFadeley began by stating that he had met Weaver in 1987 at an\nAryan Nations summer conference in Hayden Lake, Idaho.  The two\nthen met again October 11, 1989 (note the huge separation in\ntime) at a restaurant in Sandpoint, Idaho, to begin a weapons\ntransaction.  He stated that Weaver had said, \"He felt like he\n(Weaver) was being prepared to do something dangerous for the\nWhite cause.\"\n\nThe two later met October 24, 1989 behind the restaurant and\nlater went to a city park to make the sale.  During this second\nmeeting, Fadeley was wearing a small recording device to\ntape the conversation.  Weaver allegedly showed him an H&R 12-\ngauge shotgun with a 13-inch barrel and an overall length of\n19.25 inches.  He additionally showed a Remington 12-gauge\nshotgun with a 12.75-inch barrel and an overall length of\n24.5 inches (NFA requires minimums of 18 inches for barrel\nlength and an overall length of 26 inches).  On tape, Weaver\nis reported to have said that he could perform better work once\nhis machine shop is set up.  The two then discuss the possibility\nof future sales.  Fadeley then counts out three hundred dollars\nfor the two guns and promises the balance of one-hundred fifty\ndollars when they next meet.  (Note that the ATF could have\nsimply arrested him here.  Why did they wait until January 1991 -\nover a year later - to arrest him?  This is not explained).\n\nThe next meeting took place on Nov 30, 1989.  Fadeley stated that\nhis \"source\" had only come up with one hundred dollars instead\nof the one-hundred fifty he'd promised.  At this point, Weaver\nsuspected he was dealing with an informant, \"I had a guy in\nSpokane tell me you were bad.\"  Fadeley managed to convince\nWeaver otherwise.\n\nThe _Idaho Statesman_ states explicitly that three tapes were\nmade of conversations with Randy Weaver.  Thus, each of these\nmeetings must have been recorded.  However, the _Statesman_ also\nreported that a tape of a telephone conversation involving Vicki\nWeaver (Randy Weaver's wife) was played to the court.  There must\nhave also been phone taps.\n\nThese tapes were played to the court via both headphones and\nloudspeakers under the objections of Gerry Spence, Weaver's\nattorney.  Spence said to a KTVB reporter that he wanted to\nmake sure that the government proved its case, \"...if it has a\ncase at all...\" according to the rules.\n\nRandy Weaver tore off his headphones and wept when he heard his\nwife's voice on the tape.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge asked jurors not to hear\naccounts of the Waco fire because of possible influences on the\nWeaver/Harris case.  Exactly how such information could affect\nthis trial is not explained.\n\nOther notes: Sunday evening there was a report on KTVB concerning\nKevin Harris.  Unnamed agents within the FBI admit that they are\nsurprised that Kevin Harris is still alive.  First, they were\nsurprised that he survived the initial gunshot wound(s) sustained\nin the initial firefight at the Y-junction.  Later, when Randy\nWeaver was struck by sniper fire the sniper had reported that\nHarris had been struck (not Weaver).  Finally, there was a report\nthat the FBI agent who killed Vicki Weaver believed he was aiming\nat Kevin Harris instead.  (This is what was reported).  Critics\nare charging that the FBI was blatantly trying to eliminate the\nonly non-government witness to the deaths of Samuel Weaver and\nDeputy Marshal William Degan.  Some local people believe that\nHarris's survival is simply due to divine intervention.\n\nTuesday, April 20, 1993 will be the sixth day of the trial. \nKenneth Fadeley's testimony is scheduled to continue. \n\n"

The\nfirst is, I think that they knew very well that the children did not\nhave gas masks while the adults did, so the children had no chance\nbecause this gas was very -- she said it was not lethal, but it was\nvery dangerous to the children and they could not have survived\nwithout gas masks.  And on February 28th -- let's go back -- didn't\nthose people have a right to practice their religion?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  They were not just practicing their\nreligion, they were -- the Treasury Department believed that they had\nviolated federal laws, any number of them.\n\n     Q  What federal laws --\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me go back and answer -- I can't\nanswer the question about the gas masks, except to tell you that the\nwhole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested; they\nwere convinced that it wouldn't kill either a child or an adult but\nit would force anybody that breathed it to run outside.  And one of\nthe things that I've heard -- I don't want to get into the details of\nthis because I don't know -- but one of the things that they were\nspeculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast that\nthe windows might have been opened and some of the gas might have\nescaped and that may be why it didn't have the desired effect.\n\n     They also knew, Sarah, that there was an underground\ncompound -- a bus buried underground where the children could be\nsent.  And they were -- I think they were hoping very much that if\nthe children were not released immediately outside that the humane\nthing would be done and that the children would be sent someplace\nwhere they could be protected.\n\n     In terms of the gas masks themselves, I learned\nyesterday -- I did not ask this fact question before -- that the gas\nwas supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masks\nthemselves were to work.  So that it was thought that even if they\nall had gas masks, that eventually the gas would force them out in a\nnonviolent, nonshooting circumstance.\n\n     MS. MYERS:  Last question.\n\n     Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying that --\n\n     Q  Could you tell us whether or not you ever asked\nJanet Reno about the possibility of a mass suicide?  And when you\nlearned about the actual fire and explosion what went through your\nmind during those horrendous moments?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  What I asked Janet Reno is if they had\nconsidered all the worse things that could happen.  And she said --\nand, of course, the whole issue of suicide had been raised in the\npublic -- he had -- that had been debated anyway.  And she said that\nthe people who were most knowledgeable  about these kinds of issues\nconcluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there would\nbe tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in\nthe future.  That was the judgment they made.  Whether they were\nright or wrong, of course, we will never know.\n\n     What happened when I saw the fire, when I saw the\nbuilding burning?  I was sick.  I felt terrible.  And my immediate\nconcern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they were\nescaping or whether they were inside, trying to burn themselves up.\nThat's the first thing I wanted to know.\n\n     Thank you.\n\n     Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying it was a\nJanet Reno decision?  Isn't it, in the end, your decision?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I'm saying is that I didn't\nhave a four- or five-hour, detailed briefing from the FBI.  I didn't\ngo over every strategic part of it.  It is a decision for which I\ntake responsibility.  I'm the President of the United States and I\nsigned off on the general decision and giving her the authority to\nmake the last call.  When I talked to her on Sunday, some time had\nelapsed.  She might have made a decision to change her mind.  I said,\nif you decide to go forward with this tomorrow, I will support you.\nAnd I do support her.\n\n     She is not ultimately responsible to the American\npeople; I am.  But I think she has conducted her duties in an\nappropriate fashion and she has dealt with this situation I think as\nwell as she could have.\n\n     Thank you.  (Applause.)\n\n -30-\n"

Deputy\nU.S. Marshal Larry Cooper took the stand for the prosecution.\n\nThe short version is that his testimony was consistent with\nthe opening statements for the prosecution.\n\nCooper testified that he had arrived in Spokane (Washington)\non August 17, 1992 to participate in a surveillance operation\nwith five other deputies near the Weaver cabin.  The team was\nusing night vision equipment for surveillance, and split up\ninto two teams of three people.  The six later met at an\nobservation point above the cabin.  After this, deputies\nCooper, William Degan, and Arthur Roderick began a descent to\nscout further possible surveillance sites.\n\nCooper told the court that Roderick threw two large rocks into\na gully to see, \"whether the [Weaver family] dogs would respond.\"\nStriker, the Weaver's yellow lab, started toward them barking\nloudly.  Roderick led the three in a run from the area.\n\nThey ran through some dense woods into an open area [called the\n\"fern field\"] with the dog in pursuit.  By this time, Kevin\nHarris and Samuel Weaver had joined the chase.  The surveillance\nteam had reached a Y in the road: Cooper decided that they should\ntake cover in the woods because otherwise they would be an easy\ntarget and might be \"shot in the back.\"\n\nAs Degan reached the Y, he spotted Randy Weaver coming down the\nroad from the cabin ahead.  Weaver was startled but did not fire.\n\nAt this moment, Striker reached Degan, and Cooper had to \"fend\nhim off with his gun.\"  [It is unclear whether this means he\nclubbed the dog or shot the dog].  Both Cooper and Degan then\ntook cover in the woods.  According to Cooper, Kevin Harris and\nSamuel Weaver continued walking down the road, apparently not\nnoticing the two.  After they had passed by on the road, Degan\ngot up on one knee, raised his gun, and shouted, \"Stop!  U.S.\nMarshal!\"  Harris then \"...brought the weapon around at hip level\nand fired.  He didn't bring the weapon up to eye level.  I saw\nBill's arm going back, and I knew he had been hit.\"  Cooper fired\nat Harris, and Harris went down.  Cooper then brought his weapon\nto bear on Samuel, but did not fire.  At this point, Cooper then\nheard two shots to his right.  Samuel Weaver looked in the\ndirection of the shots, yelled, \"You son of a bitch!\" and ran\ntoward them.  Cooper then realized that shots were coming at him\nfrom directly ahead, so he fired a three-round burst at the\ncabin.  At this point he then saw Samuel Weaver running toward\nthe cabin.  When Cooper reached Degan, he placed his first two\nfingers on Degan carotid artery, counted two or three beats, and\nthen his heart stopped.  Shortly thereafter, Roderick and the\nother three marshals joined him.  They then all heard a large\nburst of gunfire from the area around the cabin.\n\nOn cross-examination, David Nevin questioned the point of\nthrowing rocks into the gulley, asking, \"You wanted to lure that\ndog out so you could shoot that dog, didn't you?\"  Nevin also\npointed out that in last September's testimony, Cooper had\nclaimed that he spotted Weaver after the dog had left him.\nCooper claimed that he had gone over the events in his head and\ndecided that Thursday's account was correct.  Nevin continued the\ncross-examination by asking what Cooper would have done had an\narmed man dressed in full camouflage jumped out of the woods at\nhim [no answer was available].\n\nFriday, April 16 marks continued cross-examination of Cooper.\n\nNotes: There was no coverage of protestors.\n\nDrew\n==============================================================\n\n-- \n**************************************************************\n* Ron Phillips               crphilli@hound.dazixca.ingr.com *\n* Senior Customer Engineer                                   *\n* Intergraph Electronics                                     *\n* 381 East Evelyn Avenue               VOICE: (415) 691-6473 *\n* Mountain View, CA 94041              FAX:   (415) 691-0350 *\n**************************************************************\n"

I suppose \"the authorities\"\nmight have been a better term than \"society\".

Funny, \n   though, how the criminals in such places continue to have a \n   lush supply of guns and no compunctions about using them.  \n   IMHO, you don't need to be either a political philosopher or \n   a crime victim to realize that there's a flaw in the gun-\n   grabbers' logic.  \n\nAgreed.\n\n   You're welcome to your HO, too, the First Amendment being as \n   important as the Second, but please don't let your obvious \n   good intentions be subverted by insupportable generalities \n   about something as big and diverse as US society.\n\nMy only intention was to comment that the existence of suitable\nweapons of self defense doesn't mean you'll escape a whole shitload\nof trouble should you be forced to use them.\n\n   Or by the\n   naive hope that making gun possession a crime will give pause \n   to someone who would be a criminal anyway.\n\nI made no such statements, nor do I have such a naive hope or outlook.  \n   \n   Wishing you peace and the wherewithal to defend yourself\n   if others' thoughts are not that kindly,\n\nThat's all I want: the opportunity to leave in peace, or to \nhave the means to defend myself when that in not possible.\n\nI *think* we agree on this issue.

A certain number of them actually are threatened. There are\nimmediate threats, the things that women will tell you they're afraid\nof. The noise downstairs at night. The lonely walk to the car. The\nstranger at the door. The abusive husband, finally kicked out of the\nhouse as he threatens to hurt her and their children. The burglar... The\nmugger...the rapist. \n\nAnd what are we told is the solution? Move. Get a dog. Keep the door\nlocked. Call the police. as a next-to-last resort, learn martial arts. and\nalways, there's the implied question \"what's a pretty little thing like\nyou doing without a husband around to protect you?\n\nBut what if you don't like dogs? Like living alone? Don't have 10\nyears to devote learning judo?\n\nWhat if, after examining the facts, a woman learns that \"rape victims\nusing armed resistance were less likely to have the rape completed -\nand were less likely to be injured(Kleck,124) than those using any\nother form of resistance (Kleck,126) (also true for\nrobbery/assault)(Kleck,123) \n\nWhat if, to our horror and despair, we find that citizens cannot depend\non the police for effective protection - they usually respond after a\ncrime has been committed. In truth, the Supreme Court has held that\nthe police are not responsible for protecting any individual, only the\nwhole community.\n\nAs a society, are we going to ask women, once again, to sacrifice\nthemselves? Are we going to continue to deny women the ability to\nhelp themselves?\n\nHere's a thought. Neil Smith, in his book The Probability Broach, says\n\"no 220 pound thug can threaten the well being or dignity of a 110-\npound woman who has two pounds of iron to even things out.\" But if\na woman decides to protect herself, with the easiest, most efficient\nmeans possible, people - especially other women - are horrified.\n\"Eughh, how could you? I'd be terrified!\" they ask. How could you\nhurt someone? They'll repeat the lie: it'll just get taken away from\nyou. In truth, 1% of \"defensive gun uses\" result in the offender taking\nthe gun away from the victim.(122,Kleck)\n\nWell, despite the lies, and the social pressure, some of us have already\nmade that hard choice. We've decided that we are not going to be\nvictimized by the muggers, burglars or rapists. We're buying more\nguns than every before. We're learning how to use them - and teaching\nothers, women and men, how to use them. Most importantly, we are\npreparing ourselves mentally to use our firearms for our own defense.\nWe're taking our own security, literally, into our own hands. We're\ngoing to stop begging and pleading and marching and WHAT WE\nINTEND IS TO REALLY TAKE BACK THE NIGHT.\n\nBut there's another threat, more insatiable than any mugger, more\nsecretive than any burglar, more soul-destroying than any rapist.\n\nThat menace is government, and it threatens us all. We know that\ngovernments, throughout time, have suppressed rights and oppressed\npeople. It's the way they survive.\n\nIn our names and with our money, it interferes with innocent people\nboth at home and abroad. It lies to us, cheats us, steals from us and\nthreatens us with violence. No one knows exactly what it'll do next -\nwhat freedom we will lose because some government goon decides\n\"it's for your own safety\" or \"we know best\". Any person who acted\nlike government does would be psychoanalyzed within an inch of his\nlife and locked up as a habitual offender.\n\nBut this monster called government persists, and grows. And we, who\nshould be its masters, have become its unwilling slaves. Do you doubt\nme? Then why did you file your income tax? \n\nLike any reasonable person, I believe that being afraid of something\nthat can hurt you is smart, and that paranoia isn't crazy if someone's\nreally after you. And make no mistake, they're after you and they're\nafter me. Their names are familiar: Brady and Reynolds, Groff,\nMetzenbahm, Moynihan, and Clinton. If we're lucky, they'll settle for\nour assault rifles, our shotguns, our handguns and our ammunition. \n\nAs citizens, we have only two choices. They are the same two choices\ngiven to women: to surrender or to fight. \n\nSurrender leads to the gulag, to the genocide of Pol Pot, to the\ndisappearances, to Dachau. I do not intend to surrender. \n\nA battle can be philosophical or political: in the main, the people keep\nthe government honest by threatening to vote it out of office. But if\nthey have to, they will keep in mind the words of Thomas Jefferson:\n\"the tree of liberty must be well watered with the blood of patriots.\"\n\nAs a patriot, I will point out the error in the government's ways. I will\ndo my best to vote the villains out of office. I will protest, and write,\nand speak, and teach our children justice, honor and truth. And always\nremember that Rebellion can lead to Bunker Hill and Saratoga......or it\ncan lead to Tiananmen Square. \n\nWhen the time comes to stand up, if I have to give my life to keep\nthem from going too far, if there is a Tiananmen Square in our future,\nI intend to be there. And no matter what lies they tell and no matter\nwhat laws they pass, I intend to meet them with something more\nsubstantial in my hand than a brick. \n\nMy opinions are, of course, my own.\n\n"

But to\nthink there is a visible and clear chain of command up to the Prez, and\nthat these agencies inform Reno who informs Clinton, etc. is naive.  These\nagencies operate as distinct and seperate entities and while they have\nultimate accountability to the Prez, they make their own moves, and then\ntell the Prez, who says, \"I knew all along\".  While this may not seem right,\nor it may not fit our idealistic need to see a structured chain of command\nleading to the White House, thats the way it is.  Bureaucracys are not, after\nall, composed of 3 or 4 people who talk on a regular basis, have lunch, and\nmaybe golf together.  I do agree, the FBI, BATF messed up. I'm not sure if\nthey should have stormed the compound or not.  By the way, Jehova Witnesses\nare a religious minority in this country.  Protestantism is a minority\nreligion in the World.  BDs were a cult by all definitions and history of\ncults.  To say this is not to persecute a religious or ethnic enclave.\nKoresh said he was the Messiah.  I was raised a Baptist, although I do\nnot practice the religion and do not think that the Big Guy upstairs is\ndigging the divisiveness, closemindedness, and right-wing morons that are\nassociated with the religion.  Anyway, the Messiah that I was taught about\nwould not be carrying a gun, let alone stockpiling weapons.  You can doubt\nBATF reports all you want, David Koresh was not a poor soul who was\nunjustly persecuted.  While some of the information coming from the U.S\ngovernment is being exagerated so as keep public opinion on their side, I\ndo believe that some of the things that former cult members have said\nare true.  Anyway, this is just another excuse to try and blame President\nClinton for something.  People who attempt to do this for political motives\nshould be ashamed.  THEY are the ones who are keeping this country from\nreaching its full potential.\n \n \n \n"

I hope you'll respond, and I seem to\nbe a Voice of Reason or some such (I've been recieving fan mail,\nso naturally my ego is somehwat inflated of late), and hope to\nmake a few points here.\n\n>I have NEVER spoken for a ban against guns in America !\n>What I've said is that there seems to be to MANY of them, and especially\n>to many in wrong hands....\n\n\tAnd our argument is that you cannot remove them from the people\nwho need restricting and not remove them from the people who don't.  A\nfairly simple problem, given our size and numbers.  Do you agree?  We\nall believe criminals, particularly violent criminals, should not have\nfirearms.  The problem is making a law that does this without trodding\nupon the rights of the vast majority.  Nobody here seems to be able to\ndo it, and I doubt anybody in Norway can either.  Thus, we are left with\na philosophical difference: does the safety of a few justify restricting\nthe many?  We say \"no,\" while others say \"yes.\"\n\n>Now IF you would like to reduce the number, how would you do it without\n>affecting good/responcible gun owners ??\n\n\tCan you provide a method that cannot be abused?

You might remember how a\nChamberlain \"gave a little\" to a particular fascist/short asshole,\nand how such \"appeasement\" worked.  While it might work in some\ninstances, it doesn't work in others, and since we cannot predict\nthe future we must be cautious in using actions that have a\nhistory of failure.\n\n>Cars and guns should really not be mixed, I just tried to make a point.\n>Like America, Norway has some spaces you have to cross to get from a to b,\n>so a car is essential in most parts....\n>Guns on the other hand are not essential in Norway, so we don't \n>argue that IF we 'banned' guns we HAVE to ban cars.....\n\n\tCars are not essential in Norway any more than they are in\nthe USA.  I'm willing to bet that you have neighbors that would be\nwilling to drive you anywhere you wanted to go for a price.  Thus,\ncars are not essential for your transportation.  However, the\narguments presented show that, since cars are used to kill far more\npeople than guns in the USA, it makes much more sense to restrict\ncars than it does guns.  How one defines \"essential\" often depends\nupon what one is willing to go through for that service.  When we\nlook at the raw data, such comparisons are not individually weighed.\n\n>EVERYONE who believe that Hitler and WW2 could be avoided if there were\n>more guns in Germany in the 30's: PLEASE read some HISTORY!\n\n\tThis depends upon what the populace was willing to do.  As\nDesert Storm proved, even an armed populace won't just revolt even\nwhen given a chance.  Still, would Hitler have done all that he did\nwith an armed populace?  We have to wonder, as some of his first\nacts were to confiscate firearms.  Other points in history show\nthat dictators were overthrown by arms in the hands of the populace.\nThus, we're left wondering if Hitler would have been overthrown\nor if King George was just unlucky in keeping the USA as a colony.\nOne can argue both sides; one also has to live with each action.\n\n>Is this discussion about\n>1. Banning weapons for ALL Americans\n>            or\n>2. Making it harder for criminals to get one ??\n\n\tIt is about #2, but so far all proposals to curtail #2 have\nwound up enforcing #1 as well.  I only wish that \"or\" was so logical.\n\n>Change of name.......\n\n\tThat was, on my part, purely in jest.  I merely pointed out\nhow we were from similar backgrounds racially, but of wholly different\nbackgrounds politically.  I thought this would underscore my point on\nhow our cultures were so different despite similar heritage.\n\n>Did the BATF get the warrant for a gun search only or was there other reasons.\n>(Child abuse for instance)\n\n\tBATF can *only* enforce gun/tobaccco/alcohol violations.

There many people alive today who were born in \n>a city called Konstantinoupolis. \n\nI know it doesn't make sense, but since when is 'Napoleon' about\nsense, anyway? Further striking bigoted and racist attitude of \ncertain Greeks still exists in our day. Most Greeks insist even \ntoday, that the 537 year-old capital of the Ottoman Empire should \nbe called not by its rightful name of Istanbul, but by its half \na millennium-old moniker 'Cons*(whatever).'\n\nEveryone knows that New York City was once called 'New Amsterdam'\nbut Dutch people do not persist on calling it that today. The name \nof Stalingrad too is long gone, replaced by Volgagrad. China's\nPeking traded its name for Beiging long ago. Ciudad Trujillo\nof the Dominican Republic is now Santa Domingo. Zimbabve's\nold colonial capital Salisburry became Harrare. These changes\nhave all been accepted officially by everyone in the world.\n\nBut, Greeks are still determined on calling the Turkish Istanbul \nby the name of 'Cons*.'\n\nHow can one explain this total intransigence? What makes Greeks\nso different from other mortals? 18-year-old questionable\ndemocracy? Why don't they seem to reconcile with the fact,\nfor instance, that Istanbul changed hands 537 years ago in\n1453 AD, and that this predates the discovery of the New \nWorld, by 39 years. The declaration of U.S. independence\nin 1776 will come 284 years later.\n\nShouldn't then, half a millennium be considered enough time for \n'Cons*' to be called a Turkish city? Where is the logic in the \nGreek reasoning, if there is any? How long can one sit on the \nlaurels of an ancient civilization? Ancient Greece does not exist, \nany more than any other 16 civilizations that existed on the soil \nof Anatolia.\n\nThese undereducated 'wieneramus' live with an illusion. It \nis the same mentality which allows them to rationalize\nthat Cyprus is a Greek Island. No history book shows\nthat it ever was. It belonged to the Ottoman Turks 'lock,\nstock and barrel' for a period of well over 300 years.\n\nIn fact, prior to the Turks' acquisition of it, following\nbloody naval battles with the Venetians in 1570 AD, the\nisland of Cyprus belonged, invariably, to several nations:\n\nThe Assyrians, the Sumerians, the Phoenicians, the Egyptians,\nthe Ottoman Turks, of course in that order, owned it as \ntheir territory. But, it has never been the possession\nof the government of Greece - not even for one day -\nin the history of the world. Moreover, Cyprus is\nlocated 1500 miles from the Greek mainland, but only \n40 miles from Turkiye's southern coastline.\n\nSaddam Hussein claims that Kuwait was once Iraqi\nterritory and the Greek Cypriot government and \nthe terrorist Greek governments think that Cyprus\nalso was once part of the Greek hegemony.\n\nThose 'Arromdians' involved in this grandiose hallucination\nshould wake up from their sweet daydreams and confront \nreality. Again, wishful thinking is unproductive, only \nfacts count.\n\nAs for Selanik,\n\n  <<Those Jews who survived these assaults in Southeastern Europe fled\n  particularly to Salonica, whose Jewish population increased substantially\n  as a result, from 28,000 in 1876 to 90,000 in 1908, more than half the\n  total population, though even there increased persecution by local Greeks\n  led many Jews to flee elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire, particularly to\n  the great port of Izmir.\n\n  Despite all the pressure from Ottomans and foreign Jews alike, the ritual\n  murders and other assaults by Christians on Jews went on and on. Greek\n  efforts to decimate the Jewish population of Salonica culminated in 1912\n  and 1913, following Greek conquest of Salonica during the first Balkan War,\n  when many of its Jews, were either killed or terrorized into leaving...>>\n\n  <<Though Greece was obligated by the post World War I treaties to allow\n  Jews and other minorities to use their own languages in education and to\n  practice their religions without hindrance, a law was issued in 1923\n  which forbad all inhabitants from working on Sunday, stimulating a new\n  Jewish exodus as it was intended to do. Between 1932 and 1934 there was a\n  series of anti-Semitic riots in Salonica, with the Cambel quarter, where\n  most of the remaining Jews lived, being burned to the ground. This\n  was followed by regulations requiring the use of Greek and prohibiting\n  Hebrew and Judea-Spanish in the Jewish schools. A start was made also\n  on expropriating the land of the principal Jewish cemetery in Salonica\n  for use by the new University in order to derive the Jews out [47]. By\n  killing and driving out large numbers of Jews, the Greeks left a\n  substantial Greek majority in the city for the first time, and starting\n  Salonica Jewry on the way to its final decimation by the Nazis during the\n  occupation of Greece starting in 1941.\n\n  Salonica and Izmir of course were not the only places of refuge for\n  Jewish refugees entering the Empire during its last century of existence.\n  Istanbul, Edirne, and other parts of Rumelia and Anatolia received\n  thousands more. Nor were Jews the only refugees received and helped by\n  the government of the Sultan. Thousands of Muslims accompanied them in\n  flight from similar persecutions wherever Balkan christian states gained\n  independence or expanded. The Russian conquest of the Crimea and the\n  Caucasus starting in the late eighteenth century, and particularly during\n  and after the Crimean War, combined with the same independence movements\n  in Southeastern Europe that had caused so much suffering and flight among\n  its Jews caused thousands of helpless, ill, and poverty-stricken Muslim\n  refugees to accompany them into the ever shrinking boundaries of the\n  Ottoman Empire, with the Istanbul government struggling mightly but vainly\n  to house and feed them as best it could. From 1850 to 1864 as many as\n  800,000 Crimean Tatars, Circassians, and other Muslims from north and\n  east of the Black Sea had entered Anatolia alone, as many as 200,000 more\n  came during the next twenty years, while 474,389 refugees entered in 1876-\n  1877 as a result of the Ottoman wars with Russia and the Balkan states,\n  with an equal number gaining refuge in the European portions of the\n  Empire.>>\n\n[47] Robert Mantran, 'La structure sociale de la communaute juive de\n  Salonqiue a la fin du dix-neuvieme siecle', RH no.534 (1980), 391-92;\n  Nehama VII, 762; Joseph Nehama (Salonica) to AIU (Paris) no.2868/2,\n  12 May 1903 (AIU Archives I-C-43); and no.2775, 10 January 1900 (AIU\n  Archives I-C-41), describing daily battles between Jewish and Greek\n  children in the streets of Salonica.

The Lebanese Army is over 30,000 troops and\nunified like never before.  Hizbollah can have no moral justification\nin attacking Israel proper, especially after Israeli withdrawal.\nThat would draw the ire of the Lebanese the Syrian and the\nIsraeli gov'ts.

Dec. 1989\n\nLeading Israeli author and cultural commentator, A.B. Yehoshua,\nlaunched a ferocious attack on diaspora Jewry at a Zionist Youth\nCouncil meeting in North London, last week.\n\nThe diaspora, he claimed, \"was the cancer connected to the main\ntissue of the Jewish people\". He was scathing about its failure to\nact before the Holocaust.\n\nHe said the diaspora's religious and secular leadership had\nignored the warning signs in the 1920s, and had fiercely opposed\nZionism. Consequently, he considered the Holocaust, \"the failure\nof Judaism\".\n\nHis talk, entitled \"Diaspora: A Neurotic Solution\", covered 5,000\nyears of Jewish history.\n\nMr. Yehoshua's other targets included Soviet Jews who were, he\nsaid \"not staying [in Israel], but running [away]\", and all Jews\noutside Israel \"who were using other people's countries like\nhotels\".\n\nThe only conclusion he could draw was that the diaspora was\nimmoral, because it looked to Israel for its identity but lived\nelsewhere.\n\nWorse, it threatened Israel itself, creating a distraction for her\ncitizens, who were leaving by the thousands.\n\nMr. Yehoshua, who described himself as \"a soldier for aliyah\",\nended by calling for the creation of a new \"total Jew\", living in\nIsrael.\n\nEarlier, speaking at a meeting of Jewish students on the\ndifficulties of forging a national identity in Israeli literature,\nMr. Yehoshua claimed that Israeli writers were paralyzed by the\ncountry's political situation.\n\nHe said Israel's wars had once provided writers with a vital\nsource of inspiration.  Today, Israeli writers avoided writing\ndirectly about the Arab-Israeli conflict. No major work had been\nproduced about the intifada.\n\nInstead, writers were tackling themes such as Jewish identity,\nemigration from Israel and personal and family issues.\n\nMr. Yehoshua admitted he also felt unable to write about the\nIsraeli political situation. He could no longer step into an\nIsraeli Arab's shoes and portray him as a real \"flesh and blood\ncharacter\".\n\nHe claimed that after 40 years of statehood, the problem of\nIsraeli identity had not been solved. He said Jews remained too\npre-occupied with the borders of identity between Jew and non-Jew,\nand were not concerned with the nature of that identity.\n\nJewish values in Israel embraced every aspect of daily life,\nunlike in the diaspora, where Jews had no responsibility for the\ncountry they lived in, he said.\n\nHe warned that modern Hebrew, a unifying force for the Jewish\npeople, would have to struggle for its future, especially in\nliterary circles. It faced fierce competition from the English\nlanguage.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n"

Verbitsky) writes:\n\n>\tActually, Jarmo is a permanent resident of my killfile\n\nAnyone care to speculate on this? I'll let the rest of the net judge\nthis on its own merits. Between 1914 and 1920, 2.5 million Turks perished \nof butchery at the hands of Armenians. The genocide involved not only \nthe killing of innocents but their forcible deportation from the Russian \nArmenia. They were persecuted, banished, and slaughtered while much of \nOttoman Army was engaged in World War I. The Genocide Treaty defines \ngenocide as acting with a \n\n  'specific intent to destroy, in whole or in substantial part, a \n   national, ethnic, racial or religious group.' \n\nHistory shows that the x-Soviet Armenian Government intended to eradicate \nthe Muslim population. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were exterminated by the \nArmenians. International diplomats in Ottoman Empire at the time - including \nU.S. Ambassador Bristol - denounced the x-Soviet Armenian Government's policy \nas a massacre of the Kurds, Turks, and Tartars. The blood-thirsty leaders of \nthe x-Soviet Armenian Government at the time personally involved in the \nextermination of the Muslims. The Turkish genocide museums in Turkiye honor \nthose who died during the Turkish massacres perpetrated by the Armenians. \n\nThe eyewitness accounts and the historical documents established,\nbeyond any doubt, that the massacres against the Muslim people\nduring the war were planned and premeditated. The aim of the policy\nwas clearly the extermination of all Turks in x-Soviet Armenian \nterritories.\n\nThe Muslims of Van, Bitlis, Mus, Erzurum and Erzincan districts and\ntheir wives and children have been taken to the mountains and killed.\nThe massacres in Trabzon, Tercan, Yozgat and Adana were organized and\nperpetrated by the blood-thirsty leaders of the x-Soviet Armenian \nGovernment.\n\nThe principal organizers of the slaughter of innocent Muslims were\nDro, Antranik, Armen Garo, Hamarosp, Daro Pastirmadjian, Keri,\nKarakin, Haig Pajise-liantz and Silikian.\n\nSource: \"Bristol Papers\", General Correspondence: Container #32 - Bristol\n         to Bradley Letter of September 14, 1920.\n\n\"I have it from absolute first-hand information that the Armenians in \n the Caucasus attacked Tartar (Turkish) villages that are utterly \n defenseless and bombarded these villages with artillery and they murder\n the inhabitants, pillage the village and often burn the village.\"\n\n\nSources: (The Ottoman State, the Ministry of War), \"Islam Ahalinin \nDucar Olduklari Mezalim Hakkinda Vesaike Mustenid Malumat,\" (Istanbul, 1918). \nThe French version: \"Documents Relatifs aux Atrocites Commises par les Armeniens\nsur la Population Musulmane,\" (Istanbul, 1919).

When the Russian army\n withdrew, a part of the remaining people was destroyed in Armenian\n massacres and cruelties: they were thrown into wells, they were locked\n in houses and burned down, they were killed with bayonets and swords, in places\n selected as butchering spots, their bellies were torn open, their lungs\n were pulled out, and girls and women were hanged by their hair after\n being subjected to every conceivable abominable act. A very small part \n of the people who were spared these abominations far worse than the\n cruelty of the inquisition resembled living dead and were suffering\n from temporary insanity because of the dire poverty they had lived\n in and because of the frightful experiences they had been subjected to.\n Including women and children, such persons discovered so far do not\n exceed one thousand five hundred in Erzincan and thirty thousand in\n Erzurum.

Not before.\n\nSomebody mentioned that Gaza is 'foreign country' and therefore Israel\nis entitled to close its borders to Gaza.

Yet I fail to see how this Israeli form of\n   terrorism was better than the terrorism practiced now by the\n   Arabs.  These Jewish terrorist groups killed innocent British\n   soldiers, but not only thta also killed many Jews who were in\n   favor of a compromise with the Palestinians.\n\nThe Irgun killed SOLDIERS,  which is a legitimate way to drive an unwanted\nfogriend regime from a country.  They didn't kill blindly their families or\nsuch (not as a policy,  I agree that brits which were not soldiers also were\nkilled sometimes) nor they killed Arabs just for being Arabs.\n\nIn case I have to remind you the difference,  the majority of the attacks of\nthe Arab terrorist organizations was on civilians.

Machiavelli described the reasoning in the\nPrince. The clear intention was to create a constituency which the Likud\nbeleived could not be deprived of the land stolen from the indigenous\npopulation.\n\nThe pretexts under which the settlers aquired land was through the \nredefinition of much land used in common as \"public land\". The assertion\nthat the village common on which the village depends for food belongs to\nan invader simply because no individual has title is clearly an\nexcuse. When the land is used to build a condominium for aliens brought\nin to occupy the land for a foreign power there is a clear breach of the\nGeneva convention which stipulates that land use in occupied territories\nmust not be changed. \n\nNo amount of self justifying on the part of Likud and hard linner appologists\nwill change the fact that the majority of world governments, and all of\nthose that actually have any power have condemned this practice.\n\n\n|>\tThe government had a number of reasons for encouraging people\n|>to move across the green line.  They included security and politics.\n|>\n|>\tThe first reason was security.  A large Jewish presense makes\n|>it difficult for terrorists to infiltrate.  A Jewish settlements also\n|>act as fortresses in times of war.\n\nTheyu also are a liability. We are talking about civilian encampments that\nwould last no more than hours against tanks,\n\n|>\tA second reason was political.  Creating \"settlements\" brought\n|>the arabs to the negotiation table.  Had the creation of new towns and\n|>cities gone on another several years, there would be no place left in\n|>Israel where there was an arab majority.  There would have been no\n|>land left that could be called arab.\n\nDon't fool yourself. It was the gulf war that brought the Israelis to the\nnegotiating table. Once their US backers had a secure base in the gulf\nthey insrtructed Shamir to negotiate or else.\n\nIf the creation of settlements had gone on any longer the USA would have\ncut the money supply.\n\n|>\tThe fact that there are a hundered thousands Jews in place\n|>changes the face of any peace settlement, and restricts what land can\n|>be given away.\n\nNot at all.

Since the\nPalestinians will remain heavily dependent on Israel indefinitely it\nis this that will be the guarantor of peace. another factor will be the\nreturn of lands confiscated by the Israeli state within Israel and the\ndismantling of the shadow structures which allow discrimination against\nnon-Jews within what is nominaly a secular state. \n\nThe irony is that in return for a guarantee that the palestinian state has\na non descrimination law in order to protect the remaining settlers the\nIsraeli state is going to be forced inot the same position. This will mean\noutlawing of discrimination such as that which prevents arabs from buying\nor using much of the land. \n\n\n\nPhill Hallam-Baker \n"

And I really don't want to discuss how.)\nNote that a million dead Gazans don't get much more headline\nspace than a dozen, and are just as soon forgotten -- and once\nexterminated, they can't keep popping up as headlines.\n\nSo if a \"Final Solution\" for Gaza would be so much better from\na *Realpolitik* standpoint, why doesn't Israel go for it?

If you look at the amount of money spent defending Korean \nshipping lanes, Norway, and other trouble spots in the world, you will see that\naid to Israel - from a practical standpoint - is not that much.  And so what -\nso what if Israel gets the most (assuming I buy your feeble argument)?  What \nis your point?  Do you not want to subsidize Israel?  Well, you have two options\n1) Start your own campaign, get elected as president, and then force congress\nto cut all aid to Israel or 2) get the fuck out!  If  you don't like how this \ncountry operates and can't change it then move to Iran or something.\n\nAll my love,\nEd.\n\n"

Perlman) writes:\n>>\n>>In a word:  utter and complete horse puckey.  Look the term up in the\n>>dictionary.\n>\n\nOK. Lets look into this.\nAccording to my dictionary,\nZi-on-ism: an international movement orig. for the establishment of a Jewish\nnational or religious community in Palestine and later for the support of\nmodern Israel.\n\nNow, I do not support the establishment of nations based on religious \nprinciples, while I support the establishment of nations based on cultural\nidentities.\n\nSo. Here are some questions I have to ask for anyone to answer. My point\nis what someone said long time ago: In politics, like with men, it is important\nto distiguish between what they say they do and what they are actually\ndoing.\n\n1) My mother is Jewish (and so is my father). If I apply for the Law of\nReturn, do I get in as a Jew trying to return to his land, from which my\nfamily was expelled about 2000 years ago?\n2) If I go back, which nationality would my ID show?\n3) If I decided to go back to the land from which my relatives had been \nexpelled 2000 years ago, but first I convert to any other religion, can I \napply to the law of Return as a member of the Jewish Nation or should I \napply as someone whose mother is Jewish?\n4) Which nationality would show my ID in case 3)?\n5) What has change in me between the day before and the day after I converted\nto loose my being part of the Jewish Nation?\n6) Suppose I want to get married to my current wife, who is non-Jewish in\nIsrael, how do I do it?\n7) How would my situation change if I decided, after going back to\nIsrael, to convert to Islam?\n\n\nNow, here is one more question. I do believe that most people in a country\ndo not care about politics. They just want to be left alone.\nSuppose my father is Arab. Suppose he was born in Palestine, in some place \nwhich now is part of Israel. Suppose that his father, and his grandfather as\nwell as 20 or 30 generations before him were born in that place.\nNow suppose there is a war of independence and my father, scared by all the\nfighting going on, tries to take his family to a place more secure, among \npeople he knows, who speak a language he understands, who worship the same\ngod. Now, suppose that that place is some other Arab country. \nAnd, now suppose that the war is over and that there is a new country created\nwhere my father used to live, and that that country is called Israel.\nAnd, that in that country, Jews from all over the world are received. And\nthat people whose family left thet country 200 generation ago are recieved and\ngranted full-citizenship.\nShould I, if I decided to go back to my father's land, where he was born as\n20 or 30 generations of my family were born, have the right to go back and\nask to be recognized in the same way those who are returning after 2000\nyears?\n\nThen, finally, people ask me how I would define a Jew, but that is irrelevant.\nI am not talking about how I would define a Jew, but about how people in \nZionist organizations, and more important, in Israel, define a Jew.\nHow would those who are Zionist define a Jew? \n\n\n\n\n>\n>>     Eric S.

The reasons are pragmatic: even if\n>Bosnian Muslims are Croats and Serbs who converted to Islam under\n>Turkish rule centuries ago, none of the present generation has any\n>clue what was their ancestor's actual nationality.  In fact, although\n\nI am forced to disagree with you. First of all, one may have been \nborn from a non-Turkish, non-Muslim parent outside the Turkish land, \nyet still can be a Turk, provided this person calls himself or herself \na Turk. Because the designation of a Turk is not a genetic feature,\nnot a racial or religious feature. It is a matter of identifying\nwith the Turkish values. Secondly, the following observations by \nWesterners were written in French by Ahmet Cevat: \n\n\"If Turks had behaved like Christians to use force to convert to Islam the\nnations which they brought under their power, to which no one could have\nopposed, today there would be no Eastern problem. But Turks did not do so. \nThey obeyed the word of the Koran to permit everybody \"to worship in their own\nway\" centuries before Frederick the Great pronounced his famous dictum. Thus,\nin an age when the Christian Europe itself shed Christian blood and when \npeople in Europe enjoyed inflicting inhuman tortures upon those whose beliefs\ndiffered from theirs, the Ottoman Empire became the sole country where the\ninquisition did not exist, where deaths at the stake were unheard of and \nwhere accusations of witchcraft were not made. And the barbarian (!) Turkey\nwas the only country where the Jews persecuted and chased away everywhere\nby the Christians, could find asylum. These facts demonstrate that Muslim\ncountries provided spiritually far better living conditions than Christian\ncountries.\"[1]\n\n\"The Turks, who are a conquering nation, did not Turkify the nations that came\nunder their rule; instead, they respected their religions and traditions. It\nwas a stroke of luck for Romania to live under Turkish rule instead of\nRussian or Austrian rule. Because otherwise there would not have been a\nRomanian nation today\" (Popescu Ciocanel).\n\n\"Turks rule over people under their administration only externally, without\ninterfering with their internal structures. On account of this, the autonomy\nof minorities in Turkey is better and more complete than any in the most\nadvanced European countries.\"[2]\n\n\"...human beings hate each other on account of religious differences. This flaw\nis older than Islam and Christianity. But there has never been any examples\nof this adjuration in Turkey because Turks never oppress anybody on account\nof his religion. If enmity on the basis of religion had been such a case of\nsimple contempt among us too, or if it did not keep translating itself into\naction, many nations in our Europe would probably have considered themselves\nhappy!\" (A. de Mortraye).[3]\n\n\"Turkey never became a scene for religious terror or for the cruelty of the\ninquisition. On the contrary, it served as an asylum for the unfortunate\nvictims of Christian fanaticism. If you look into history, you will see that\nin the fifteenth century thousands of Jews who were expelled from Spain and\nPortugal found such a good asylum in Turkey that their descendants have been\nliving there very calmly all through these approximately three hundred years,\nand are only forced to defend themselves in some countries against the\ncruelty of Christians, especially that of the Orthodoxes. No Jew is able to\nappear in public during Easter celebrations in Athens, even today. In Turkey,\nhowever, if the Israelites are insulted by the Greek and Armenian communities,\nlocal courts immediately take them under their protection.\"\n\n\"In that vast and calm country of the sultan, all religions and nations are\nliving together peacefully. Although the mosque is superior to the church and\nthe synagogue, it does not replace them. Because of this, the Catholic sect is\nmore free in Istanbul and Smyrna compared with Paris and Lyon. In addition \nto the fact that no law in Turkey prohibits the open-air ceremonies of this \nsect, neither does any law imprison its cross in the church. While the\ndead are being taken to the graves, a long line of priests bear processional\ncandles and chant Catholic hymns. When all the priests in all the churches in\nthe Galata and Beyoglu districts go into the streets and form clerical\nprocessions during the Eucharist celebrations, chanting hymns and bearing\ntheir crosses and religious banners, a detachment of soldiers escorts them\nwhich forces even the Turks to stand in respect around the group of \npriests.\" (A.

However,\n\nThis is quite a misrepresentation.  After WWI, many Bosnian Muslims were\nkilled and their land taken over by Serbs, and the motive was plunder,\nnot some fictitious \"supression of rebellion.\"  Even earlier, one can\npoint to the destruction of mosques in Serbia itself and expulsion of\nMuslims.  Here is what Dr. Vaso Cubrilovic, political adviser to the\nSerbian monarchic regime, says in his memorandum \"The Expulsion of the\nArnauts\" which he presented to the royal government of Stojadinovic\non March 7, 1937, in Belgrade:\n\n   The Mode of Removal\n   -------------------\n\n   [ describes how expulsion of ethnic Albanians from Kosova is to proceed\n   through state terror and \"private initiative\", i.e. Chetnik plunder: ]\n\n   Private initiative, too, can assist greatly in this direction.  We should\n   distribute weapons to our colonists, as need be.  The old forms of Chetnik\n   action should be organized and secretly assisted.  [...]\n   ...the whole affair should be presented as a conflict between clans and,\n   if need be, ascribed to economic reasons.  Finally, local riots can be\n   incited.  These will be bloodily suppressed with the clans and the\n   Chetniks, rather than the army.\n\n   There remains one more means, WHICH SERBIA EMPLOYED WITH GREAT PRACTICAL\n   EFFECT AFTER 1878, that is, by secretly burning down Albanian villages\n   and city quarters.\n\n(Emphasis above is mine.)  These events in Serbia itself forced out virtually\nall Muslims during late 19th century.  This policy of state terrorism\nagainst Muslims, aided by Chetnik \"private initiative,\" has continued in WWII\nand today.  For example, Muhamed Hadzijahic in his book \"Od tradicije do \nidentiteta: Geneza nacionalnog pitanja bosanskih Muslimana\" (Sarajevo:\nSvjetlost, 1974) writes (pg. 235) how Serbs killed a Muslim in Foca\nin WWII even though he claimed to be a Serbian patriot, explaining\ntheir action as follows:\n\n   \"Inasmuch as you were a Serb, you sullied the Serb name, because you\n   are a Turk [i.e. Muslim].  And since you helped us, we shall not\n   torture you.\"\n\nso the shot him instead of cutting his throat.  In the past year, Serbs\nhave repeated the slaughter of Muslim residents of Foca.  Destruction\nof mosques, including priceless historical monuments, completes the\neradication of the Muslim presence from territories claimed by Serbs.\n\n\n>>I strongly dispute your notion that Croats had a similar older agenda,\n>>in fact, for the past century or two, Croats and Muslims have seen\n>>themselves as having a lot in common, and they generally had friendly\n>>relations.  Your suggestion that Croat-Muslim relationship is \n>>anything like Serb-Muslim relationship is completely wrong.\n>>\n>>To say that Croats and Muslims have a lot in common does not imply\n>>they are not separate peoples.  ....\n>\n>\tHow touching.

However \n>\tone of the main agendas is turning Bosnia into purely Catholic state.\n\nCroatia never had many Muslim citizens for historical reasons, because it\nwas not a part of the Ottoman Empire.  The last major battles between\nAustro-Hungarian monarchy and the Ottoman Empire in Croatia were at the\nend of the 17th century.  Need I remind you that modern Croatian nationalism\ncame into being with Dr. Ante Starcevic, who saw Bosnian Muslims as the\nbest Croats, so much so that in 1853 he contemplated moving his operations \nto Sarajevo?  You are confusing clericalist Croatianism with Croatian\nnationalism here.   Political nationalism has always been stronger.  As\nfor your other theories, you are clearly overjoyed that Croat-Muslim\nalliance in Bosnia-Herzegovina is now in trouble.  Arguments such as\nyours are clearly intended to create and deepen this split.  \n\n>\tI should add few more things.  A.J. Evans, in his \"On Foot Through\n>\tB&H\" describes that Catholic clergy in the last century was \n>\tapparently more scared by Serbs, then by Turks, because Serbs were\n>\tgrowing stronger and, unlike Turks, represented great danger for\n>\tidea of Catholic Bosnia.

Balance of power thinking has brought together Croats\nand Bosnian Muslims.  This is only natural; all other alignments are\nunstable.  I'm working on pointing out this basic fact: Croats and\nMuslims have been aware of it for as long as Serbia has existed.  \nYou are wrong if you think only \"image\" is at stake here.  Croatia has\na deep interest in her alliance with Bosnian Muslims, and vice versa.  \n\nI think Tudjman understands this, although he does not have much choice \nat this point.  Tensions should have been defused better earlier, before \nany open confrontation developed.  Although I still think Croatia will\nsurvive, it will lose a lot; but Bosnian Muslims may end up even worse\noff.  However, their position now is so horrible that perhaps they do not\nsee it getting any worse.  The key point is: do they still have any hope left?\nIf not, then all bets are off.\n\nMr. Stojanovic is clearly very, very happy about this.  I'm deeply hurt.\nThis is not about some \"image\" but about survival of a concept of a\npartnership which I believe is natural and essential for both Croats\nand Muslims.  \n\nSigh...\nJosip\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Have the eye-witnesses been day-dreaming?\nWere these stories forged by Turkish journalists in the region?\n\nThe nonsense of such a claim is clear from the writings of British\nJournalists, too. Two days before we had quoted from a Sunday Times\narticle. They[British] reported the events in Karabag even before\nTurkish journalists. What is more here are the pictures. Pictures\nof people who were bayonetted, whose eyes were gouged, ears cut off.\n\nEven the Armenian Radio couldn't claim these \"lies.\" They are saying\n\"exaggeration.\" That means ''somethings'' have happened but the\nsituation is not as bad as reported. Perhaps that village of Khojalu\ntown was destroyed in 4 hours, instead of 2... Or Gulsum Huseyin's\n3 year old daughter was bayonetted in her chest instead of stomach...\n\nThe massacre is clearly seen with all its dimensions. The effects of\nthis massacre on Karabag and environs cannot be reduced by any word.\n\nSome of the western press', led by some French Newspapers, ability\nto ''close their eyes'' is nothing but complicity in this massacre.\n\nYesterday we gave samples from Le Figaro. Until yesterday's print\nno news about the real events in Karabag were printed. So were the\nFrench TV channels.. The subject they considered related to Karabag\nwas ''The necessity of protecting Armenians against Azeri attacks.''\n\nThe age we are living in is termed a human rights age. There are lots\nof organizations such as United Nations and CSCE(Conference on Security\nand Cooperation in Europe), and rules, all designed to fight against human\nrights violations. International reactions must be made with international\ncooperation. With support of everybody and every organization claiming\nto be civilized.\n\nCould there be a more serious human rights violation than that of the\nright to live -and with such levels of barbarity and cruelty-? Where\nis the cooperation? Where are the reactions? And the intellectuals,\njournalists, writers, TV stations of certain western countries such\nas France who are fast to claim leadership of \"human rights?\"\nWhere are you?\n\nSerdar Argic\n\n                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\n                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \n                            a single Turkish soul.'

PST\n\t     \n\t     \n\t     Folks, we're about to start the BACKGROUND BRIEFING \non the aid package.\n\n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Good morning.  The \nPresident -- President Clinton and President Yeltsin agreed \nyesterday on a series of American initiatives to support economic \nand political reform in Russia, and it's valued at $1.6 billion.  \n\n\t     Before taking your questions and running through the \nbasic outlines of this package, I want to make a few points.  \nFirst, this is the maximum that the Clinton administration can do \nwith available funds to support Russian reform.  All of the funds \nhave been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  There is \nno need for the administration to go back to the Congress to fund \nany of these programs.  All our Fiscal Year '93 funds currently \nare available, so in effect, all of these programs can begin \ntomorrow.\n\t     \n\t     The second point is that this package is designed to \nsupport Russian reformers.  All of the initiatives in the package \nare directed at reformers and for their benefit, and all have \nbeen worked out with prior consultation with the Russian \ngovernment.\n\t     \n\t     Third, the President is determined that we will \ndeliver on these commitments this year.  The package is designed \nto maximize our ability to support reform.  In designing it we \nwanted to avoid making commitments that we could not meet, and we \nfeel very confident that we can meet all of these commitments in \nfront of you.\n\t     \n\t     Fourth, I'd like to note the special importance of \ntrade and investment.  I think it's fair to say that Russia's \ncapital and technology needs throughout the next decade extend \nwell into the hundreds of billions of dollars.  No collection of \ngovernments can meet those needs; only the private sector can do \nso.  And so the President and President Yeltsin agreed to make \ntrade and investment a major priority in the relationship.  \n\t     \n\t     They also agreed that there would be a new joint \ncommission on energy and space formed, headed on the U.S. side by \nVice President Gore; on the Russian side by Prime Minister \nChernomyrdin.  And the goal of this effort is to break through \nthe barriers to trade and investment on both sides and to promote \na vastly expanded relationship.\n\t     \n\t     If it would be helpful I'd be prepared to run down \nthe first page, which is a summary of U.S. assistance, and just \ngive you some general background on what these programs are.  \nI'll do it quickly and then I'll be glad to take questions.\n\t     \n\t     The first group of initiatives are humanitarian food \nand medical assistance.  This is part of our effort which has \nbeen underway for several years to provide basic humanitarian \ngrant food assistance so that the Russian government can assure \nthere's at least a minimal amount of bread on the shelves in the \nmajor cities.  That's $194 million in grant -- that is from Food \nfor Progress, the grant portion of Food for Progress.  We'll also \nbe continuing our grant assistance in medicines and \npharmaceutical supplies, and that's $30 million.\n\t     \n\t     The second item is concessional food sales.  As you \nknow, the United States has had a long-term grain relationship \nwith Russia.  It's important to us and it's important to Russia \nthat we continue that relationship.  The President has chosen the \nFood for Progress program which is a concessional loan program.  \nThe value over the next seven months is $700 million.  These are \nconcessional terms.  The exact terms have not been worked out, \nbut I think it's fair to say there will be a grace period on \nprincipal of six or seven years, and concessional rates \nthereafter for the life of the deal.\n\t     \n\t     The third program is a collection of private sector \nsupport.  We think this is one of the most important things we're \ngoing to do.  Privatization and the creation of small businesses \nis the number one priority of the reform government in Moscow.  \nAnd so the President has decided to create a Russian-American \nenterprise fund capitalized this year at $50 million.  And the \ngoal of this fund is to make direct loans to small businesses in \nRussia, to take equity positions in those businesses.  \n\t     \n\t     The President has also decided to create a \nprivatization fund which would work directly with the Russian \ngovernment in its priority objective of trying to convert state \nenterprises from a state-owned basis to a private basis.  He has \nalso agreed -- the President has also agreed to establish a \nEurasia foundation.  This would be a private foundation led by \nprominent Americans to fund democratization projects in Russia.\n\t     \n\t     The fourth grouping you see there in the summary \npage is democratization itself.  I think it's fair to say that \nthis administration has given a new impetus to the goal of \npursuing democratization in Russia.  You see that we have a total \nof $48 million in programs, various programs.  The detailed \ntables give an indication of some of the programs that we're \nlaunching.  \n\t     \n\t     The President is also calling for the development of \na democracy corps, which will be an overarching umbrella group to \ntry to incorporate all of the disparate private and public \nefforts now underway from the United States to support reform in \nRussia.\n\t     \n\t     The fifth program you see is Russian office of \nresettlement.  This is a new initiative created and \nconceptualized by this administration.  This is a demonstration \nproject.  What we'd like to do is work with the Russian military \nto help resettle Russian officers returning from the Baltic \nstates and other parts of the former Soviet Union.  We want to \nmake sure that we work out the best way to do that, whether it's \nwith Russian labor and Russian materials or using prefab American \nconstruction.  And so we've decided to fund on a demonstration \nbasis the construction of 450 housing units.  We'll be working \nvery closely with the Russian military on this.  And I would say \nthat we have a long-term commitment to this project.  \n\t     \n\t     The sixth area is energy in the environment.  They \nare two issues that the President feels strongly about.  Our \ninitial efforts will be feasibility studies to look into the \npossibility of enhancing their energy production, both oil and \ngas; and equally important trying to cut down on the leakages in \nthe oil and gas pipeline systems, which cause so much \nenvironmental damage.\n\t     \n\t     I've talked a little bit about trade and investment, \nabout the new group being created that the Vice President will \nchair on our side.  Secretary Ron Brown will also be cochairing \nwith Deputy Prime Minister Shohkin, a business development \ncommittee, which will work in all other sectors of the economy, \nto break down the many barriers that currently exist and impede \ntrade and investment.  We are also going to appoint a full-time \ninvestment ombudsman in the American government to work on this \nproblem full-time.  \n\t     \n\t     And the point I'd like to make here is, trade and \ninvestment in the 1990s is every bit as important, to draw an \nanalogy, as arms reductions was in the '70s and '80s.  And we \njust thought that in looking at this we needed to make a \ncommitment within our own government to have people work on it -- \nsenior people on a full-time basis, because it is terribly \nimportant.\n\t     \n\t     You'll notice that the United States is going to \nsupport Russia's membership in the GATT.  Russia has had observer \nstatus.  Russia has requested our support and, in fact, requested \nour advice in becoming a member of the GATT.  We think that the \nlong-term goal of drawing Russia into the global economy is \nparamount, a very important goal.  And that is why we are \nsupporting the membership in the GATT.  We are also supporting \ntheir access to GSP, the Generalized System of Preferences.  \n\t     \n\t     You'll note that Ex-Im has extended $82 million in \ncredit for a caterpillar deal in Siberia, that OPIC has extended \n$150 million in credits and loan guarantees for a Conoco oil \nproject.  I'd like to emphasize that we are very close to an \nagreement between Russia and the United States for a $2-billion \nframework facility through the Ex-Im Bank that would finance \nRussian purchases of American oil and gas equipment and services. \nWe think this is a very important development.  We think we'll \nget there by April 14th, which is the opening day of the Tokyo \nconference, the G-7 conference.\n\t     \n\t     Before I take any further questions, I'd like to \ndefer to my colleague, who will review the security assistance \nobjectives with you.\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Our major \nunfinished agenda with the Russians and with their counterparts \nin Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus is in the area of the safe and \nsecure dismantlement of the nuclear arsenals on their territory \nunder the terms of the START I and START II agreements.   \nRecently we completed in Moscow three, I think, very important \nagreements that devote a significant chunk of Nunn-Lugar funding \nto three important programs.  The first is the program of $130 \nmillion for the strategic nuclear delivery vehicle dismantlement \nprogram.  That is for submarines, for ICBM dismantlement and for \nbomber dismantlement -- $130 million.\n\t     \n\t     The second is a $75 million tranche of funding for \nthe construction of a facility to store nuclear materials removed \nfrom the warheads as they are dismantled.  This will essentially \ncontribute to the overall design and the early phases of the \nconstruction of that storage facility.  \n\t     \n\t     And finally, a $10-million tranche of money to help \nin the establishment of a monitoring system for the nuclear \nmaterials as they are withdrawn from the weapons system.  So we \nadd that $215-million total to the extant Nunn-Lugar assistance \nwhich has been flowing -- about $150 million for some overall \nsafety improvements for various kinds of equipment and safety \nmeasures that we have been working out with the Russians over the \nlast couple of years.  \n\t     \n\t     So this is an area where we will be going a lot more \nwork with not only the Russians but with the Ukrainians, Kazhaks, \nand Belarussians.  Belarus, for example, has just, in the last \ncouple of weeks, received up to $65 million in FY'93 funds for \nsafety, security and dismantlement programs on Belarussian \nterritory.  And this was in the wake of their ratification of \nSTART I, an agreement to accede to NPT. \n\t     \n\t     So we are working very hard with all the parties to \nthe Lisbon protocols, and will continue to work very hard with \nthem.  And I look upon these three recent agreements with Russia \nas a very important step in that process.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The OPIC funds to -- is that for the field in \nKazhakstan -- and Conoco already signed this deal with \nKazhakstan.  Why do you feel now it is necessary -- if it's the \nsame one, why do you feel it's necessary?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  It's not the same \ndeal.  Chevron signed a deal with Kazhakstan, the Tenges oil \nfield.  This is a new investment project.  It's a polar lights \noil development and renovation project, and it's being announced \ntoday.  So it's completely new.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Can you tell us more about what's involved?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yes.  Conoco, like \nother American oil companies has been searching for ways to do \ntwo things.  One, to prospect for new oil in Siberia, west \nSiberia; and two, to try to get into the business of renovating \noil wells and renovating pipelines, both oil and gas, in Russia.  \nThe objective here, obviously, is to take advantage of the \nnatural resources in Russia, increase energy production, which \nwill, in turn, increase hard currency revenues, which is what \nRussia needs.\n\t     \n\t     So we think this deal is very, very good development \nfor Russia.  The Russians do as well, and it's good for an \nAmerican company.  And the American government has played a \nleading role in pulling this together through the credit facility \nin OPIC and through the loan guarantee.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  So it's to search and also to renovate fields \nthat are already there?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  On that point, should other American companies \nexpect to get administration support for such deals, or should \nthey now go to the Ex-Im and try to get the money out of the $2 \nbillion?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as you know, \nEx-Im is part of the U.S. government and various parts of the \nU.S. government have been pushing, including the State Department \nand the White House for this deal to be consummated.  And we \nthink it will.  And if we arrive at this agreement by April 14th, \nthere will be $2 billion in financing available for American \ncompanies to sell their equipment and sell their services.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  That should take up all of the rest of the \ndeals and their won't be -- and their will or there won't be \nsupport for OPIC sort of deals such as this Conoco?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a \ntremendous amount of interest on the part of American oil and gas \ncompanies to invest in Russia.  We think that the Ex-Im oil and \ngas facility, the $2-billion facility, once it is concluded, will \nsoak up a lot of that interest.  But I think the interest may \neven extend beyond that.  And if so, the government will respond.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What's the current year budget costs of that \n$2-billion agreement should it go forward?  And is there any \ncurrent year budget costs --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I'll have to refer \nyou to Ex-Im for that.  I don't know the details of that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The concessional food sales -- is there any \ncurrent year costs to that, or is it delayed until the years in \nwhich the payments are due?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The concessional \nfood sales are from Food for Progress, which is a USDA program.  \nUSDA has the funds, we don't need to go back to the Congress to \nexpend those funds.  There will be a hit in the budget.  I'd \nrefer you to USDA and OMB for the details on that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Can you talk about the Democracy Corps?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     and the private sector -- how many folks are \ngoing to be involved in that?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Why don't I start \nwith the Democracy Corps first.  I think the administration felt \ncoming into office that there were literally thousands of \norganization, private organizations in the United States that in \none way or another were working at the goal of trying to achieve \ndemocratization in Russia, helping on a farmer-to-farmer basis.  \nAnd there were literally 10 or 15 U.S. government agencies that \nhad a variety of programs in this area.  And so the \nadministration felt -- the President felt it was important to try \nto draw all of these initiatives together under one group to give \nsome coherence to the efforts and to give some impetus to the \nefforts.  And so this is a presidential initiative.\n\t     \n\t     It will be headed by Ambassador Tom Simons who will \nsoon take up his duties as the coordinator for U.S. assistance in \nthe former Soviet Union.  And we're very hopeful that we might \nuse this Democracy Corps not only to draw upon the resources of \nour own government, but the resources of the American private \nsector and schools and communities across the nation.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     any kind of commitment yet, any kind of word \nyet on FY'94, and any new money that needs to be appropriated \nbesides the $300 million the President talked about?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The administration \nis requesting additional funds in FY'94 of $700 million.  What \nthe President has done this weekend is to consult really \nintensively yesterday with President Yeltsin about additional \nmeasures the United States could take in some of these areas to \nsupport reform.  He'll be consulting with the Congress.  When he \nreturns to Washington, he'll be consulting also with the other \nally governments, and we'll make a decision at that time.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Two questions about the $700 billion \nagricultural money.  First of all, I thought it was the sort of \nconsensus that what Russia did not need was more loans for food.  \nSo why did you decide to do it that way?  Secondly, could you \nexplain -- agriculture has been stopped from making further loans \nfor food because of Russia's inability to pay.  How does this fit \ninto that situation?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As you know, the \nUnited States for a long time has been a major supplier of grains \nand food commodities, agricultural products to Russia.  I think \nbetween 1991 and '92 we had extended -- a little bit of history \nhere -- about $5.5 billion in credits, credit guarantees, through \nthe Commodity Credit Corporation.  That was the principal vehicle \nto ensure the sale of American grain products.  On December 1 of \nlast year, '92, the Russian government stopped its payments on \nthat program.  They are now in arrears to us on that program, and \ntherefore, by law, the United States cannot continue that \nprogram.  And so the President, working with Secretary Espy and \nother officials in the Cabinet, looked for other ways that we \ncould promote American grain sales.  \n\t     \n\t     And I think we have two ways to do that.  We've \nannounced today $194 million in grant food assistance through the \nFood for Progress program.  But we do not have sufficient \nauthority to spend $700 million in grant food, and so we looked \nfor a concessional loan program.  \n\t     \n\t     I think everybody agrees that Russia -- that a \nshort-term loan program for Russia would not make sense now, but \na long-term concessional loan program would.  And that is what \nthis program is.  It will provide, once the final details are \nworked out, for a six to seven-year grace period on payments of \nprincipal.  And then from years seven through 15, which is the \nlife of the deal, it will provide for concessional rates of \ninterest -- generally around three to four percent.  And so we \nbelieve and the Russian government believes this is a good deal \nfor them because it will avoid the imperative of early payments \nand put them into the out years, but it will also continue this \nvery important grain relationship, which is important for them, \nand it's important for the American farm community.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I gather from what you say that this could make \nit explicit -- the Russians' failure to pay the interest on ECC \nloan does not in any way affect this kind of loan going through, \nis that right? \n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Let me be explicit \nabout that.  We are prevented under the law to from continuing  \nthe Commodity Credit Corporation short-term credit program \nbecause of Russia's arrearages to the United States.  All of you \nknow about those arrearages.  They total about, I think, around \n$640 million.  USDA can give you an exact figure.  So having \ntaken that into consideration and wanting to preserve American \nmarket share and a long-term grain relationship, wanting to \nrespond to a specific request from the Russian government for \nmajor food assistance, knowing that we couldn't take it from the \ngrant programs because we don't have sufficient authority there, \nwe looked at Food for Progress, which is a program we've used to \ngreat effect in other parts of the world.  And we consulted with \nthe Russian government and arrived at this solution.  \n\t     \n\t     I think the Russians are pleased because it provides \nthem with the food, but also gives them a little bit of relief on \nthe short-term payments.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Where do those funds actually come from?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  They come from the \nFood for Progress program, which is a program under USDA's \nauthority.  USDA has the authority to spend these funds.  We do \nnot need to go back to the Congress for these funds.  And I want \nto make that general point again:  Everything in this package, \nthe $1.6 billion package, comprises funds that have already been \nallocated and appropriated by the Congress.  The administration \ncan begin to spend these monies tomorrow.  And it's very \nimportant in our eyes that we expend all the funds this year, \nthat we meet these commitments.  And we are confident we'll be \nable to do so.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  How did you arrive at the figure of $700 \nmillion -- does that max out that program, or did you actually \nhave a range from 0 to --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a reason \nfor it.  The reason was that the Russian government told us \nthat's about the amount of grain that they needed between now and \nharvest time.  And so the idea is that we would begin the \nshipments probably $100 million per month from now until the \nharvest in the autumn, at which time Russia won't require the \nsame level of food imports from the West.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I would imagine there's going to be some \nconsiderable envy and jealousy on the part of some of the other \nrepublics because of the size and the scope of this with Russia.  \nHave you given any consideration to advancing negotiations for \nthe same kinds of projects with the Ukraine, with Georgia , with \nsome of the other republics?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, we're very \nconscience of the fact that we also have an interest in extending \nAmerican support to the 11 other countries of the former Soviet \nUnion.  We have told ourselves, and we have planned that in the \narea of technical assistance, the grant technical assistance that \nyou see, roughly 50 percent of the funding will go to Russia and \nroughly 50 percent to the other countries. \n\t     \n\t     In the area of food sales, we have been active with \nUkraine, in grant food assistance with Georgia and Armenia.  We \nwill continue that.  And I think it's fair to say that after this \nsummit we will go back and look at all of our programs with the \nother countries to ensure that they are adequate and they are \nproductive and they're hard-hitting.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Has anything happened at the summit to lead \nAmerican energy companies and other companies to believe that \nRussia is going to be more user-friendly toward them in terms of \ntaxing, legalities, bureaucracy?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, one of our \nprimary objectives coming into this summit was to highlight,  not \nonly the economic agenda, but also trade and investment.  And I'd \nlike to refer to the point I made at the beginning.  We're \nconvinced in talking about this problem -- the problem of how to \nsupport Russia long-term -- we're convinced that no collection of \nWestern governments have the financial resources over the next \ndecade to fuel the continuation of reform, that only the private \nsector can do that.  \n\t     \n\t     We look at our own society and we see tremendous \ncapability in resources in the oil and gas sector.  It is a very \ngood match with what the Russians need now, which is financial \ninvestment in the existing oil and gas wells and pipeline and new \ntechnology and new capital to finance new production.  \n\t     \n\t     That's what the Russian government has told us it \nwants to do, and so that's why we have made such a major emphasis \non it.  That's why trade and investment was a prominent issue on \nthe first day of these talks, and in fact, figured prominently \nlast night in the meeting between President Yeltsin and President \nClinton.  And we're hoping that together we might send a strong \nsignal to the American business community that we support their \nefforts to invest in Russia, that the United States, through Ex-\nIm and OPEC and the Department of Commerce, will be there to \nsupport them.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  My question is, is Yeltsin in any position to \ndeliver on making Russia a more --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We think he is.  I \nwould note that President Yeltsin's Prime Minister, Mr. \nChernomyrdin, worked for 30 years in the Russian oil and gas \nsector.  He will now chair a high-level commission with the Vice \nPresident, Vice President Gore, to try to break through the \nbarriers that currently exist to Western investment in the oil \nand gas sector.  We believe we have a commitment to make that \ncommittee an important committee.  And we're looking forward to \nthe work.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What type of mechanism is already in place to \nadminister the private sector portion of the program?  And will \nthe U.S. be directly involved in the tail end of distribution of \nthe actual funds or is the money simply turned over to the \nRussian government for distribution at their will?\n\t     \t    \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Are you talking \nabout the variety of programs listed here?  It depends on the \nprogram itself.  In most cases, though, we are either working \nthrough American PBOs or American government agencies to ensure \nthat the money obviously is well spent, that the money gets to \nthe intended source.  That's an obligation we have to the \nCongress to ensure the money is well spent and that we can \naccount for the money.  We have done that in the last couple of \nmonths intensively and we will continue to do it for each of \nthese programs.\n\t     \n\t     But they are all quite different.  For instance, in \nthe area of grant food and medical assistance, for grant food it \nis carried out through USDA and USDA accounts for the delivery of \nthe food.  For grant medical assistance, we've been working \nthrough Project Hope which is a private organization.  For the \nhousing -- for instance, the resettlement of Russian officers, \nwe'll be working with a group of American PBOs.  On some of the \ndemocratization projects, we're working directly with Russian \nprivate individuals and private foundations.  We're working with \njournalists in Russia on a media project that you may have \nnoticed.\n\t     \n\t     So we literally have here 30 to 40 different \nactivities under all these rubrics and they're all going to be \ncarried out in slightly different ways.  Some directly with the \nRussian government, some with Russian citizens.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The Jackson-Vanik restrictions that remain and \non the COCOM restrictions that remain, can you tell us what the \nPresident has to do on that?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as George \nnoted yesterday, President Yeltsin raised these as irritants in \nthe relationship.  The President has noted that.  I think it's \nfair to say we will go back now in our own government when we \nreturn to Washington and look at both of these questions, and \nwe'll get back to the Russian government.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You were not prepared for these questions when \nyou got here?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We were prepared \nfor these questions.  We've looked at them.  But we're not \nprepared to make a quick decision this weekend.  They require --\nlet me just explain, particularly on Jackson-Vanik.  They require \nconsultation with the Congress.  They require consultation with \nthe American Jewish community.  And we're very sensitive to those \nconcerns.  And so we'll want to go back and talk to them before \nwe take any action.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is this package designed so that you will not \nhave to go to Congress for anything at this point?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As I said at the \nbeginning, the advantage of this particular package is that all \nthe funds have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  \nSo the administration will not have to go back to the Congress to \nseek any additional authority to fund any of these efforts.  In \neffect, they can all begin tomorrow, and I know that many of the \nagencies responsible for these projects will begin tomorrow.  And \nthat's the advantage of this particular initiative.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  If this, as the President says, is a long-term, \nlong-haul thing, and members of Congress are at this moment \nheading for Moscow, why aren't you talking about going to \nCongress and suggesting to the President of Russia that you are \nprepared to go to Congress for various things?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think we've been \nclear about that.  The President is discussing this weekend with \nPresident Yeltsin some additional ideas that we have for American \nfunding of additional projects, and ideas that he has.  We have a \nmajor congressional delegation that left last night, headed by \nRepresentative Gephardt and we'll want to consult with that \ndelegation and other members of Congress before doing anything.  \nAnd we'll also want to consult with our allies.  So that's where \nit stands now.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  We've been told repeatedly that a number of \nthese items represent different or new ways of spending the money \nalready appropriated.  Could you just tick off which of these \nitems represents reprogramming or at least spending money in ways \nthat it was not previously set to be?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that we've \nsaid that these are all projects that either Congress had \nallocated money for through the Freedom Support Act; there were \nsome funds that were left over from FY'92.  And this \nadministration took office and had some new ideas about how the \nfunds might be expended.\n\t     \n\t     We didn't use just the Freedom Support Act funds or \nthe FY'92 funds.  We went into some of the agency allocations --\nEx-Im, OPIC, and USDA -- and tried to look for creative ways to \nfurther our programs.\n\t     \n\t     And example of that is the Food for Progress \nconcessional loans.  We had hit a brick wall with another type of \nfunding through USDA.  We could not go forward legally, and so we \nlooked for a more creative way to ensure continued American \nmarket share and ensure continued grain sales, and we think we \nfound it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Where, for example, are you getting the money \nfor this Russian officer resettlement --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's from the \nFreedom Support Act funds.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  In other words, all of the money is being \ndirectly spent in new ways, so to speak --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Most of the grant \nprojects that you see -- if you look at the general chart, the \nsecond chart, it's broken down into grant and credits.  And if \nyou look under grants, the technical cooperation projects that \ntotal $281.9 million -- that is almost all Freedom Support Act \nfunding.  A little bit of it is leftover funds from fiscal year \n'92.  The Nunn-Lugar funds, of course, you know about the \nlegislative history of those funds.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     cooperation --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  From FY '92?  I \ndon't have the exact figure.  It was not a considerable figure.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Could you tell us please, has anything happened \nhere this weekend that will break the log jam between Ukraine and \nRussia over START -- for START I and II as a result of what's \nhappened here --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Both presidents, \nPresident Yeltsin and President Clinton, will be discussing this \nissue this morning.  In fact, we haven't yet gotten to security \nand arms control related issues.  That will be this morning's \nsession.  I know that President Clinton will be very strongly \nreinforcing that this is a top priority for us.  We've been \ntalking to the Russians and the Ukrainians over the last couple \nof weeks about ways that we might help to facilitate the \ndiscussions between them.  Up to this point, this has been a very \nimportant negotiation that's been going on essentially between \nMoscow and Kiev.  And we are at the point now of essentially \ndiscussing with them if there are ways that we could contribute \nto this discussion, help to move things forward essentially.  \n\t     \n\t     But in terms of what is coming out of this weekend, \nI don't yet know.  In a couple hours we'll know.\n\t     \n\t     Q?\t    Just a follow-up on the financing here.  Is \nany of this robbing Peter to pay Boris -- since it's all current \nyear appropriations, have you taken it from anyplace that's been \nearmarked and put it into this fund?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There are smoke and \nmirrors here, and I think it's an important point to note.  We \ncould have given you a page of assistance numbers that included \nout-year funding.  We're going to make a long-term commitment to \nmany of these projects -- for instance, the enterprise funds, the \nprivatization effort, the housing effort.  And we've already \ntalked to the Russians about our long-term commitment.  \n\t     \n\t     We could have put in really big numbers and this \ncould have been a bigger package, but we wanted to make a point:  \nThis package is FY '93.  It's funds that we have.  And we're \ngoing to do what we say we're going to do.  And the President \nfeels very strongly about that.  In the past there is a legacy \nthat the western governments, the combination of governments, put \nup large budget figures and for any number of reasons we're not \nable to meet them, we're determined, and the President is \ndetermined, to carry out every single program in this package.  \nAnd we'll do it.  \n\t     \n\t     But we do have a longer-term commitment, and that's \npart of the discussions on economics this weekend.  We're looking \nfor Russian ideas on what it is we can do to most effectively \nsupport reform.  And we've told them that we do have a commitment \non some of these programs beyond this fiscal year.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     taken it way from any --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, we haven't.  \nOkay, the question is, have we reprogrammed any of these funds; \nso have we taken it from other countries to pay for programs in \nRussia?  The answer is no, we have not done so.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  In terms of funding, there is no available \nmonies left -- and you simply find a creative way to find money \nsomewhere else.  Doesn't that, in fact, support the -- theory?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Not at all.  I \ndon't think it does.  That's a particular example, and the \nexample is grain sales.  The Commodity Credit Corporation credit \nguarantee program was short-term loans that Russia had to pay \nback within 12 to 15 months.  You all know about Russia's debt \nproblem, and Russia was unable to meet those commitments.  So we \nlooked for a way to do two things:  to meet Russia's requirement \nfor grain.  They're a net grain importer on a massive scale, and \nalso meet our objective of making sure that the American farmers \nhave a chance to sell their products to Russia.  And we simply \nlook for another way to finance that.  And we have legislative \nauthority to do it.  This program has been successful in other \nareas.  We had not tried it before in the former Soviet Union, \nbut we thought we should now.\n\t     \t  \n\t     Q\t  Isn't this really the Bush-Clinton aid package \nfor Russia, since these funds were really first derived by \ninitiatives put forward by President Bush?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I don't think \nthat's a fair characterization.  A lot of these funds were \nappropriated by the U.S. Congress is 1991, in 1992.  This \nadministration took office and inherited some obligations that \nthe Bush administration had made.  But we had a long six to seven \nweek review of this program.  We decided to meet the commitments \nthat had been made by the previous administration.  \n\t     \n\t     But we have gone well beyond them in funding the \nenterprise fund, which was just an idea, but the idea had not \nbeen filled out with a program.  There was no number attached to \nit.  In grouping together some projects and trying to make them \ninto a coherent whole in the privatization effort, I would say, \nis another Clinton initiative.  \n\t     \n\t     Further, we listened to the Russian government and \nlistened to the Russian military who told us that the \nresettlement of their officers was important to them for \npolitical and economic and social reasons.  And President Clinton \nhas responded to that.  And we are making a long-term commitment \nthat beyond this demonstration project we're going to figure out \na way to do much more in trying to settle those officers.  \n\t     \n\t     I would also say that the President has given \nimpetus to all of us in the agencies to think much more broadly \nabout what it is we can do on democratization, because there we \nhave some experience and some comparative advantage that lends \nitself to the Russian experience.  And in calling for the \ncreation of a democracy corps, which is another new initiative, \nwe're hopeful that we can take the resources of the private \nsector as well as the American government, to achieve that \nobjective.  \n\t     \n\t     So I would not characterize it that way at all.  And \nas most of you know, I am a career civil servant.  I was in the \nlast administration.  I'm very familiar with what the last \nadministration did.  And I would characterize this as a Clinton \nassistance package for Russia.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  There's been a lot of criticism that aid in the \npast has not gotten to the people.  Is there anything in this \noutside of the ombudsman, that will guarantee that this money \nwill not just disappear because it's being administered by the \nRussian government?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that -- I \nknow that the President and other senior officials of our \ngovernment are concerned that American money be spent wisely and \nthat it get to the source that it's intended -- for which it's \nintended.  And so we're going to take great care -- AID and the \nState Department will take great care in making sure that the \nfunds are expended properly and that they're reaching their \nsource.\n\t     \n\t     I would not that this package is not simply a \npackage of support solely to the Russian government.  Some of \nthese projects, especially in democratization and exchanges, are \ngoing to be worked out directly with Russian private individuals, \nwith businesses.  The private enterprise support is another \nexample of that.\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If I could just add \na word on this point with regard to the SSD-related programs, one \narea that we've been looking at very, very closely is \nconsideration of actually using Russian firms in subcontracting \nfor these kinds of programs.  They would be working very closely, \nof course, with the American firms, who would be the prime \ncontractors.  But this is a fine example, I think, of a more --of \na imaginative and flexible approach toward getting some of that \nfunding down to the grassroots level, down to the ground in \nRussia; but at the same time ensuring that it is spent \nefficiently and for the purposes for which it was intended.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  When would the democracy corps start?  Exactly \nwhen do you see this happening?  How would get it off the ground?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the President \nis today calling for the creation of a democracy corps.  I think \nit's fair to say that we're going to work out its framework over \nthe next couple of weeks.  Ambassador Simons takes up his duties \non May 1st.  But in effect we've already started, because over \nthe last couple of weeks the administration has begun to reach \nout to people in the private sector who have come to us asking us \nto help facilitate their activities in Russia.  And we've said \nthat we will be helpful.  We've also tried to kind of coordinate \nin a much more effective way the activities of our own \ngovernment.  We do have 10 or 15 agencies that are active in \nRussia in one way or another.  We think it makes sense to draw \nthem together and to focus their efforts.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Excuse me.  How much of this $1.6 billion will \nactually be spent in the United States by American made goods?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't have any \nfigures for you now, but perhaps we could try to work something \nup in the next couple of days on that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  This figure is larger than the figure that has \nbeen in the press -- did this program grow yesterday as a result \nof the discussions, or have we just been that far off the mark?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I think --\nunfortunately the press has been a little bit off the mark, and \nI'm sorry to say that.  No, this package -- President Clinton put \nus to work about seven weeks ago on this package.  And he was \nbriefed intensively on this.  He contributed a lot of the \nintellectual leadership in this package.  He contributed a lot of \nthe ideas in the package.  And I think it's fair to say that we \nhad this rough package worked out about two weeks ago.  We have \nbeen refining it ever since.  We spent a couple of days last week \ngoing over it with the Russian government, both the embassy in \nWashington and the government in Moscow through our own embassy.  \nAnd so it's been evolving.  But this particular package has been \ntogether for about two weeks.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Where is Yeltsin's input into this then?  There \nwas so much talk before about the President wanted to get \nYeltsin's views about specifically what was needed and so forth.  \nIs that in the out years?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, it's both.  \nPresident Yeltsin has on several occasions told us, for instance, \nthat support for the creation of private businesses is important \nto him; that the resettlement of Russian military officers is \nimportant; and that first and foremost the effort to privatize \nthe state industries is important to them.  \n\t     \n\t     And so what we did was to try to make those the \ncenterpiece of our technical assistance part o the package.  We \nlistened to him.  On the privatization effort, we have been \nworking with the Russian government for months on this trying to \nwork out all the details.  So the Russian government on most of \nthese programs was involved every step of the way.  \n\t     \n\t     But let me get at the other part of your question.  \nThe President is also using this weekend to talk about a broader \nset of initiatives that we might undertake.  And we're looking \nfor his ideas.  The President has brought his own ideas to the \ntable -- for instance, on energy and the environment and in \nhousing.  But we're looking for Russian ideas not.  We need to \nconsult with the Congress; and we need to consult with the other \nallied governments that are also active.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  There's essentially nothing that happened in \nthe last day and a half that measurably altered the package that \nyou came in with?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  This particular \npackage, as I said, was worked out and was ready about two weeks \nago.  We have since then consulted with the Russian government on \nthe final stages of its development, and so this weekend we've \nprimarily talked about future, about what more the United States \nand other Western countries can do to support reform in Russia, \nwhich is our base objective here.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I noticed that you -- that money appropriated \nto train bankers and businessmen and officers.  Can you tell me \nwhat about job training for workers who are displaced by \nprivatization?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  You're right; we \nhave a program to train Russian -- young Russians in banking and \nfinancial services in the United States.  Part of the housing \ninitiative, it's not just to build housing units, it's to retrain \nRussian officers who are retiring into other professions.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     money for job training for workers whose \njobs are disappearing because of privatization --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We have not yet \nallocated any money for that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Why not?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     of the $6 million is going to build 450 \nhousing units.  Isn't that a lot of money per unit given what the \nWestern dollar will buy in the former Soviet Union?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If you want to do \nhousing the right way, it's not just the building the framework \nof a house, you've got to think about all the utilities.  You've \ngot to think about the purchase of land.  You've got to think \nabout sewage and gas and electricity and so forth.  And it's also \nretraining.  It's not enough to put retired -- an officer coming \nout of -- Riga or Tallin or Vilnius in a house in western Russia.  \nWe think we have an obligation to try to retrain those officers \nas well.  This is responding to a request from the Russian \ngovernment.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     of the $6 million will go to retrain --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Are you talking about apartment buildings or \nsingle --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We're talking about \nsingle, individual dwellings.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You're saying that only 450 families will be \nserved by this?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  What I want to -- I \nthought I pointed out earlier, this is a demonstration project.  \nWhat we didn't want to do -- given the experience that the \nGermans and the Turks and the Italians have had in building \nhousing in western Russian, we did not want to leap into it with \na huge amount of money.  What we want to do is work over the next \ncouple of months and try to figure out with American \norganizations in the private sector the best way to get this job \ndone.  \n\t     \n\t     I noted that we have a long-term commitment to that.  \nAnd so I would expect that we would put a lot more money into \nthis in the future .  But we want to do it wisely; we want to \nspend the money wisely.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What is it about this program that convinces \nyou that it will protect Russia's reforms and that Russia will be \nin a position to may back the money they're supposed to pay back, \nespecially considering their other debt problem?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, look, I think \nit's important to note that the United States on its own does not \nhave the capability to fuel a continuation of Russian reform.  \nIt's got to be a collective Western effort, and we're looking to \nour allies to do more as well.  But beyond that, it's really what \nthe Russians do that is going to decide the fate of reform.  We \ncan simply play a role, and we feel we have an obligation to do \nso, which is consistent with our national interests.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did the President say that the value of the \nU.S. contribution was that it would create security and \nprosperity for the United States?  So what is it about this \nprogram that does this?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think you have to \ngo back to the fundamental objective of our policy toward Russia, \nand that is we want to do everything we can to support the \ncontinuation of reform.  We are convinced that if reformers stay \nin power, then we'll be able to continue the drawdown of nuclear \nforces, foreign policy cooperation and economic interaction, \nwhich are the three benefits to the United States from reform in \nRussia.  So it's not a simple question.  You can't just say that \nthis program is the answer.  It's a long-term question and we \nhave to make a long-term commitment to it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And then on the question of Russia's ability to \nrepay, what convinces you they'll be able to pay seven to 15 \nyears from now?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the Russian \ngovernment has made a commitment to repay, and what we're hoping \nis that if reform continues, and if they can continue to improve \ntheir oil and gas sector and earn additional hard currency \nrevenues, that Russia will be in a position six or seven years \nfrom now to pay back those loans.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     substantial government-to-government loan \nwe've ever gotten into with the Russians?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't want to \nanswer authoritatively on that.  I don't go back 20 or 30 years \non this.  But in the last four or five years, yes it is, because \nthe previous way that we financed grain exports was really to \njust ensure private bank loans.  This is a different type of \neffort.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     government loans in any other sector that \nyou recall?  I know it wasn't done in --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think it's fair \nto say this is a new and unique effort.\n\n                               END10:25 A.M. PDT\n"

Hart of the Reserve Officers Association of\n          the United States, 202-479-2258\n\n   WASHINGTON, April 13 /U.S. Newswire/ -- The Reserve Officers\nAssociation of the United States has alerted the Defense Base\nRealignment and Closure Commission that the services failed to give\nsufficient weight to demographics in recommendations made to close\n56 Naval and Marine Corps Reserve centers.\n   In letters to the closure commission and to all 86 members of\nCongress with affected locations in their constituencies, including\nSen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services\nCommittee, ROA charged that the developers of the Navy-Marine list\nignored demographics of the civilian population, particularly prior\nservice personnel.\n   ROA's executive director, Maj. Gen. Evan L. Hultman, AUS (Ret.),\nsuggested \"concern that the only plausible alternative is that they\nare intentionally attempting to foreclose the Naval Reserve\ncomponents from maintaining even today's relatively low level of\nparticipation in their parent service's Total Force of the future.\"\n   He asked the commission \"to remove from consideration all\nlocations without sufficient and convincing demographic data to\nwarrant approval of the requested action.\"\n   \"Only a few of the 56 Naval and Marine Corps Reserve\ninstallations on this list are large enough to have a significant\nimpact on the community, if closed,\" wrote Hultman.  \"The major\nissue is the cumulative impact of moving or closing such a large\npercentage of the existing locations.\"\n   Hultman reminded the commission, \"The fact that the vast\nmajority of the Reserve installations on this list do not come\nclose to meeting the minimal requirements for consideration in this\nprocess certainly supports the thesis\" that these actions are\nsimply an attempt to foreclose a substantial role for the Navy and\nMarine Corps Reserve.\n   ROA also noted \"that at the end of the 1960s, when the number of\nNaval Reservists was approximately the same as today, there were 480\nNaval Reserve facilities.  If the Navy recommendations are\napproved, there will be less than 200 Naval Reserve facilities.\"\n   Facilities on the list include seven Naval Air Stations ranging\nfrom South Weymouth, Mass., to Alameda, Calif., 28 Naval\nReserve Centers in Macon, Ga., and Parkersburg, W.Va., to\nMissoula and Great Falls. Mont.

As usual, Sahl's was \nindependent and sharp as a scalpel.\n\tMy effort can only dream of comparing favorably to Mort's. At \nleast it has a fairly popular orginating premise; everyone I'd mention the \nidea to thought it was either divinely inspired or at least past due for \ndelivery.\n\tThose reactions are based on parallels that should be obvious to the \nmost peripheral observer of the Acts of those False Prophets. Both are \nnoted for their galvanizing oratorical skills, which they both used with \npassion to generate a political cult of massive numerical proportions (in \nfact, Limbaugh claims to have an audience of just over 12 million, almost \nidentical to the number of votes cast for Hitler in the April 1932 German \nelection). Both used a myopic social perspective to build the cult, and \nenthusiastically amputated facts from the record to fabricate their \nideological quilt.\n\tThe last point is glaringly documented by passages in the opening \npages of both books. Hitler's example is when, on page 5, he claims the \nGerman nationalist terrorist Leo Schlageter (he bombed part of a railway \nline between Dusseldorf and Duisburg, being caught in the act, in 1923) \nwas \"betrayed to France by a representative of his government\" when \nthere has never been any factual foundation for such a statement.\n\tIn fact, the governments of both the Reich and Prussia, as well as \nthe Vatican, actively intervened to save him from execution, and almost \nsucceeded. Limbaugh follows suit by making the hysterically sarcastic \nclaim in his introduction that \"in a school or during a commencement \nceremony or many other public places... God is unconstitutional.\" Of \ncourse, it's not God but the official imposition of particular concepts of \nGod against an individual's will that's unconstitutional. But Limbaugh is \ntoo gleeful in his talent for distortion to want you to know that.\n\tOf course, one would assume that, by comparing the two books, \nmy main point would be that The Way Things Ought to Be is the modern \nAmerican Mein Kampf. Not really. At the time of the first German version \nof Mein Kampf, Hitler was just four months out of prison (June, 1925), \nand trying to reorganize the Nazis. He used the book to build his dozen \nmillion followers. Limbaugh, on the other hand, came up with his book \nafter building his dozen million. Twelve million went a longer way in \nWeimar Germany that it does in the Republicrat United States.\n\tThus, the more accurate parallels would be that Limbaugh's daily \nthree-hour radio show is the American Mein Kampf, the primary \npropoganda tool used to pump up the angry volume; and that The Way \nThings Ought to Be is actually the American Triumph of the Will, a \ntranslation of the same fascist message into a different medium. Also, the \nprinted word was the more important medium in Weimar Germany, since \nradio was still being thought of by impoverished Germans as a medium of \nluxury in 1925. Today, on the other hand, Americans are more likely to \nspend a few seconds to tune a radio dial at no monetary charge than drop \n$22 for 304 pages of transcripts of the same words.\n\tBut, as Mort Sahl also observed on the radio the other night, some \ncloutmeister of the radical right wants Limbaugh to be a focal point of \ntheir propoganda. (And remember, Sahl is an Al Haig conservative these \ndays.)\n\tMort might not know exactly who Rush's equivalent of Rodolf \nHess is (the book itself suggests Ed McLaughlin, the former president of \nABC radio and now Limbaugh's partner in EFM Media, the radio \nprogram's production company). But Mort himself is a veteran of the talk \nshow, having hosted them in New York, Washington and Los Angeles. He \nknows what evil lurks in the hearts of major market media men. He knows \nthat Limbaugh could not have collected his audience had not the \nopportunity been placed on a silver platter and handed to him. Limbaugh \nearns his money just as honestly as Al Capone did; it's almost worthy of a \nRICO indictment.\n\tOn questions of social issues, there is an overabundance of \nmaterial in the Limbaugh book that seems to echo Hitler's venom. For \nexample:\n\nOn Their Own Qualifications to Control Society\n\tHitler: \"Out of the host of sometimes millions of people, who \nindividually more or less clearly and distinctly guess the truth, partly \nperhaps understand it, one man [author's emphasis] must step forward in \norder to form, with apodeictic force, out of the wavering world of \nimagination of the great masses, granite principles, and to take up the fight \nfor their sole correctness, until out of the playing waves of a free world of \nthought a brazen rock of uniform combination of form and will arises\" \n(page 577).\n\tLimbaugh: \"Who needs the media when they've got me? ... The \nshow is devoted exclusively to what I think ... [the phrase \"with half my \nbrain tied behind my back to make it even\"] denotes the egress of mental \naptitude I require to engage and demolish liberals and others who disagree \nwith me ... It might take four or five years, but I'm convinced The Media \nwill slowly and reluctantly come around to my way of thinking, kicking \nand screaming all the way.\" (pages 266, 21, 299 and 273, respectively.)\n\nOn Religion as the Basis of a Nation\n\tHitler: \"In this world human culture and civilization are \ninseperably bound up with the existence of the Aryan. His dying-off or his \ndecline would again lower upon this earth the dark veils of a time without \nculture ... He who dares to lay hand upon the highest image of the Lord \nsins against the benevolent Creator of this miracle and helps in the \nexpulsion from Paradise.\" (Page 581.)\n\tLimbaugh: \"America was founded as a Judeo-Christian country ... \nBut our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile or \nambivalent toward religion ... People for whom belief in God is at best a \ncharming superstition have managed to ban prayer from the public schools \nfor the last thirty years. Is it only a coincidence that the quality of \nAmerican education has declined ever since?\" (pages 274-5.)\n\nOn Popular Culture as a Reason for Social Collapse\n\tHitler: \"The fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in ... \nOne has only to look at the menus of our movie houses, vaudevilles and \ntheatres; and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food ... \nTheatre, art, literature, movies, the press, billposters and window displays \nmust be cleaned of the symptoms of a rotting world and put into the \nservice of a moral idea of State and culture.\" (pages 346 and 348.)\n\tLimbaugh: \"Today, Hollywood is in trouble. The reason [is] that \nHollywood has forgotten who its audience is ... They make fun of people \nwho believe in God. They ridicule the traditional family, heterosexuality \nand monagamy. They disparage American heroes.\" (page 254.)\n\nOn the News Meida\n\tHitler: \"The activity of the so-called liberal press was the work of \ngravediggers for the German people and the German Reich. One can pass \nby in silence the Marxist papers of lies ... it's task is only to break the \npeople's folkish and national spine, in order to make it ripe for the yoke of \nslavery of international capital and its masters, the Jews.\" (Page 331.)\n\tLimbaugh: \"Elements of The Media have jumped on the \nbandwagon of leftist causes. The cynical journalist of the past has been \nreplaced in many cases by an enthusiastic cheerleader for causes ... During \nthe Gulf war, CNN correspondent Bernard Shaw [said] CNN is a global \nnetwork. We can't take sides. Cant take sides? --- --- ---! ... If they don't \nrealize that their freedom lies in the United States of America and that \ntherefore they should defend this nation, they are hopelessly misguided \nand, may I suggest, flirting with megalomania.\" (pages 270 and 268.)\n\n*     *     *\n\t\nTo continue these comparative excerpts is certainly possible, but \nultimately too depressing to take in one reading.\n\tAfter putting these books down, there is one undeniable fact that \nhaunts me. In the 1920s, Adolf Hitler fed depressed and frightened \nGermans the opiate of hatred of those around them; in turn, it allowed \nGermans to hand their collective national power to the Nazis. In the 1990s, \nRush Limbaugh is doing the very same thing: distributing hatred to \ndepressed and frightened Americans; in turn, it is helping the American \nradical right to maintain its power base as the 12-year nightmare of the \nReagan-Bush era comes to an end, hoping to rebuild it into their hopes for \nThe Fascist States of America.\n\tAnd if Limbaugh is not as repellant a Hitler, it is only because the \nradical right utilizes Limbaugh as its own gateway opiate. One can only \nwonder what the ultimate drug is they plan to hook America on.\n\nThe Madison Edge can be reached at PO Box 845, Madison, WI 53701-\n0845; (608) 255-4460.\n\n--- 30 ---\n\n\n"

(They do account for a somewhat larger\nportion of the difference in physicians' gross income in the two countries.)\n\nSome facts.  Malpractice insurance and awards account for less than 1% of\ntotal health care costs in the US.  In 1991, according to a survey of \nphysicians conducted by a national medical journal physicians averaged\npaying 3.7% of their practice receipts in malpractice insurance.  \nMalpractice insurance premiums and malpractice awards peaked in 1985;\nthey've declined significantly since then.  At the same time, health\ncare costs have increased more than any period in history.\n\nAs far as \"defensive medicine\" is concerned, the AMA estimates that its\ntotal impact is about $7 billion per year.  That's about 8% of the total\ncurrent INCREASE in health care costs -- and the estimate is from a group\nthat could be expected to overestimate the impacts of defensive medicine\non health care.\n\nAs small a problem as this is in the overall scheme of things, however,\nClinton has been on record for a long time favoring an indemnification\nof MD's against malpractice suits if they follow procedures set by their\nspecialties.

And the original warrant is STILL sealed.\nAnd we were told about the rockets and ammunition they had... but did\nanyone notice any ammo exploding in the fire? They claimed that Koresh\nhadn't left the compound in months... but people in town report seeing\nhim just a week before the raid.\n\nHow would I have handled it differently? \n\nWell, first, I haven't seen any evidence that the BDs did anything\nwrong. There's a sealed warrant, and a collection of stories which\nkeep changing about what they did. So I might not have done ANYTHING.\n\nOK. Now, supposing that I know what the BDs are being arrested for.\nWell, they've got a history of accepting arrests... so, I send\nofficers to the door with a warrant.

They may have calculated that the B-D followers resolve was\ncracking based on their listening devices within the compound. They\nknew that Koresh had chickened out of one suicide attempt. This\nmay have been the reason why they considered that fear might have \nbeen a weapon for breaking his resolve. Again in Panama they had used\nthe heavy rock music to great effect during Bush's invasion.

La Groupe des Cooper-\nantes built a new tower by the Eaton('s) store at Les Terraces, and if\nyou were able to catch Urban Angel on CBS's Crimetime you'd see it as\nthe well-lit one with double-turrets at the top.  As for Ontario,\nwhich still dominates and anchors business up north ...\n\nCanada is a very old-money kind of place, and the 1989 Free Trade\nAgreement saw a lot of odd alliances: labour unions and establishment\nold money who wanted to preserve their traditional monopolies on one\nside, and entrepreneurs and internationally oriented businesses and\nprofessionals on the other.  The final Trudeau administration and\nthe first Mulroney government had a high percentage of nouveaux\nriches who knew what it was like to make your own money, and that\nmotivated the McDonald Commission under Trudeau which set up Brian's\ninitiative (Macaroni was against free trade 'til he did a head count\nof his caucus after the 1984 election).\n\n>It's not really insurance if you don't have alternatives\n\nWell, you have to realize that in our society that's like saying\nthat \"it's not really national defence\" because you can't hire\nyour own Rambo squad instead or even opting out as a pacifist.\n(BTW, there are always pacifists in the news arguing about their\nportion of taxes, but never people arguing over health insurance\nalternatives ... and we're talking about a press that is hostile\nto whomever is in government, regardless of party; one of their\nfew redeeming characteristics, it seems (-;).\n\n>Also, in the April 14 Globe and Mail, there was a letter from the\n>director of trauma services at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto\n>responding to an article on a study comparing heart surgery in\n>California and Canada in which some Canadian doctor worried that\n>American analysts would seize on the results as proof that Canada\n>rationed vital services.

He said that a system in which people are refused\n>treatment because they can't afford it is no different from a system\n>in which people are refused treatment because the government can't\n>afford it as a result of deliberate underfunding of the health\n>insurance plan. In fairness, he did say that both the US and \n>Canadian systems are in the same situation.\n\nThe only way to hit at the Canadian system is transient periods of\nhigh demand, which is more a function of the doctors monopoly's tight\nfist on the licencing.  An obvious difference is that in such a\ntransient period, the rationing is of the nature of a mob battling\nover Cabbage Patch Dolls^TM as we've seen recently as opposed by\nrationing by ability to pay ... but the former is a *transient*\nsituation and if a large body of insured patients were to deluge the\nCalifornia health infrastructure, the same would result --- rationing\namong the insured population.  With smaller markets, there is much\nless flexibility when dealing with our insured population than\nCalifornia (which by the way, has 1/3rd more people than Canada in a\nMUCH more dense area).  So he is correct in that the resources are\nfixed (for a particular time window, or as a function of the doctors\nmonopoly licencing according to the market steady state) in either\ncase.  As for being \"refused treatment\" the government of the day\nwould be shredded to tatters if something like that were to happen;\nCanadians can be geographically bad, too, not realizing that their\nhealth care is private while only their insurance isn't ... too many\npeople have bought into socialist trype that we have socialized\nmedicine.\n\n>I know, I know, the monopoly power of Canadian doctors often leads\n>them to overstate the problems with the system in order to get more\n>money from the government (another case of businessmen, once\n>scratched, becoming socialists).  \n\nRight, as I've pointed out above ...\n\n>But hasn't that just shifted the locus of the problem from one place\n>to the other? It hasn't really solved it.\n\nEither way, the transient situations are hard to deal with since the\nchanges in the private medical care resource take place at a slower\nrate than the ability of people to fall sick esp. in the light of\ndisasters (e.g., Chernobyl) or bad luck (a sudden wave of heart\ndisease). A doctor needs 4-6 years of training, plus internship \nand specialty training.\n\n>People too often tend to put prescription cold medicine on their \n>insurance when they really don't need to.\n\nThat's why I've argued for deductible and copayments rather than\neducation, which is what most Canadian fiscal conservatives are\narguing for (the leftists?  \"Ah, just let 'em spend!\" --- yeah,\nright!).  Also, note that only a few provinces cover prescriptions\nunder some high dollar threshold ... in most, it's your private\ninsurance that covers it just like in the U.S.  Still, it all\nadds up in the OECD measures.\n\n>In fact, Buffalo may be the only place in the US where people\n>get Don Cherry jokes (:-).\n\nWe get the Sabres' feed as a replacement game on ESPN tonight (the\nDevils' local metro NY coverage supplants the main ESPN game).\n\n>(The NDP cleaning up a Tory spending mess?

It would tend to discourage you from overusing it.\n\nThe medical IRA would have limited use, as you'd need a lower\ncatastrophic threshold else there'd still be a drain on the public\npurse if someone exhausts their IRA.  Also, Singapore has a much\nmore autocratic mentality which has seaped down into its masses\n(if Singaporeans that I've met are any indication ... I don't\nmean any disprespect here) where they'd let you just die.\n\n>One of the good things about being the last country to create a\n>national health care system, should we decide to, is that we have\n>everybody else's mistakes to learn from.\n\nThat's true ... the question is how much leeway is there between\nthe U.S. approach and the second-most capitalist approaches of\nCanada, France and Germany.\n\n>>Seriously, there are few areas that have sufficient population for a\n>>two/more-tiered system like what the French have ... a health policy\n>>prof, D.G.

I've ragged on my own doctor friends as to why they\ndon't invest in their own private practices ... in the end, it's their\nmoney.  But they choose to spend it on America's Cup pipedreams, and\nthat's none of my business.  As for \"provincially owned\" ... for sure\nit's against the law in Canada for governments to be directly involved\nin the provision of health care except in the military or native reser-\nvations.  What that term actually means is that the facility gets by\non public grants to meet shortfall from *lack of use* ... no kidding.\nMedical practice itself is much more conservative up north.  My own\nbest friend did two clerkships at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN,\nand is no stranger to high tech medicine ... but his boat comes first.\n\n>There were some people expressing concern that it was the first wedge of\n>two-tiered health care and that it might violate the Canada Health Act.\n\nNo, it's probably socialist whiners who are offended that we have\nprivate practices ... and always have.  They can all take cash\nanyways ... so why not have a particular facility?  The Canadian\nbig government mentality often imagines government where it does\nnot even exist ...\n\nSince the French and Germans have become more entrepreneurial and less\nlaidback without sacrificing their culture and values, then Canadians\ncan do the same.  As I've pointed out above, the law states that it is\nillegal for the *government* to provide any health services except for\nthe military and natives.\n\nLook, nobody stopped the clinic when they planned on the MRI ...\nnobody stopped them when they bought it.  Nobody seems to be stopping\nthem from using it, either.  Much ado about nothing.  Thank goodness\nthat hockey playoffs have started ...\n\n>While it seemed currently unjustified, there was one anecdote told by\n>the head of the partnership to demonstrate the MRI.

I'll bet the doctor is relying on people having listened \nto American trash talk on cable so that he can puff his chest a bit.\nThere are already a few treatment regimens for knee injuries without\nrelying on MRI ... unfortunately, I've had a few. )-;  And I'm not\na banker.

This is true perhaps only for the Lega Nord.\nThe referendum Sunday is expected to establish a British/American style\nfirst-past-the-post system in the Senate.  If implemented, it would\nencourage a two- (or perhaps three-) party system in Italy.\nMost likely the DC and PSI will not be these parties; rather there will\nbe a shakeup of the entire party structure from which 2 new parties\nwill emerge to dominate.  Will Lega Nord be one of these?  Who knows.\n\n(The Camera dei Deputati (lower house) will likely remain with\nProportional Representation for a while, but there is talk of switching a\nportion of that house, too. Maybe as much as 40% first-past-the-post)\n\nOverall, the electoral reform in Italy is a welcome change.  Italians\nare tired of having crappy government.  Porn stars, Pavarotti's and\nHunters & Fishers won't gain seats because PR is dead.  A good two-party\nsystem will bring Italy efficient, accountable government.\n\nIt's about time.\n\nJeff Hagen\nhagenjd@ac.wfu.edu\n\n"

Fante} \\endauthor\n\\date {April 20, 1993} \\enddate\n\\endtopmatter\n\nIn a letter to the FBI, David Koresh said: ``Do you want me to\npull back the heavens and show you my anger?! ... fear me.''  The 51 day\nstandoff between federal agents and the Branch Davidians ended on April 19\nin what appeared to be a mass suicide by fire.  Now that the multi-million\ndollar standoff is over, a few things remain: cleaning up the mess, and\nassigning blame.\n\n\\\n\nFrom the onset of the April 19 tear gas attacks by federal agents, President\nClinton already started passing the buck by saying ``Talk to the attorney\ngeneral or the FBI... I knew it was going to be done, but the decision was\n{\\it entirely theirs}.  {\\it They} made the tactical decision.'' Enter\nAttorney General Janet Reno.  After most of the Branch Davidians died,\nReno said she took ``full responsibility'' for the decision.  ``I approved\nthe plan'' she said adding that she ``did not advise him [Clinton] as to the\ndetails.''  In fact, she told Clinton that it was ``the best way to go.''\nAs the fire was roaring through the Branch Davidian's compound Clinton said\nthat he was ``deeply sadened by the loss of life'' and in the same breath that\n``the law enforcement agencies involved in the Waco siege recommended the\ncourse of action pursued today.''  Later he went on to say ``I stand by that\n[Reno's] decision.''\n\n\\\n\nHow did this all begin?  At 0930 on February 28 agents of the Bureau of\nAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) launched a full-scale, high-profile\nassault on the Branch Davidian's compound.  This raid was much\nmore than an assault on a group suspected of possessing illegal weapons.  The\nassault was a planned media circus used as a propaganda device of the BATF\nto show their might and just purpose.\n\n\\\n\nAt the onset of the ``no-knock'' raid, gaggles of heavily armed BATF agents\nmade their way inside the compound without identifying themselves or state\nthat they had a warrant until long after the shooting began.\nSilently, the agents made their way to the compound's buildings and started\ntheir ``search'' by charging at the buildings and throwing concussion grenades\nand ordering the cult members to come out of the buildings.\n\n\\\n\nIf unknown persons dressed in black ninja costumes and combat fatigues\nwere to attack you, throwing grenades and brandishing firearms, would you not\nassume that these people are criminals and attempt to defend yourself?  The\ntactics employed by the BATF provoked the battle.\n\n\\\n\nThe initial assualt by the BATF was not successful.  Unfortunately, lives\nwere lost on both sides.  But, had the assault been a success, the liberal\nmedia would have praised the BATF by showing the footage of BATF agents\ncarting away a bunch of gun-wielding religious nuts.  Of course, any\nviolation of the cult's rights would have been overlooked and the media\nwould proclaim America's fortune in having super-cop organizations like the\nBATF that can systematically ``take out'' terroristic groups such as the\nBranch Davidians.\n\n\\\n\nAs far as I can see, the BATF and the FBI dropped the ball - just like\nPhiladelphia did in the 1985 MOVE crisis which left 11 dead, 250 homeless,\nand a city block razed.\nIt appears that the BATF has adopted the shoot-first tactic of no-knock\nraids to execute search warrants.  Don't let the BATF convince you that\nthe no-knock raid was justified.  No-knock assaults make sense when looking\nfor, say, drugs that can easily be hidden or disposed of in a few seconds.\nThe BATF was looking for illegal weapons, not drugs that could be hidden or\nflushed down the toilet in a matter of a few seconds.  What ever happened to\n``This is the police!  You are surrounded...''?  {\\it This policy of no-knock\nraids, by federal and local agencies, should be restricted}.  Further, the use\nof military firepower against presumed innocent citizens is a very scary idea,\nand is why the Davidians were justified in using lethal force to ensure that\ntheir fourth ammendment rights [``the right of the people to be secure in\ntheir persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches\nand seizures''] are not denied.\n\n\\\n\n\\\n\n\\\n\n\\noindent Matthew L.

Other than government land, saved for posterity and the eco-system\nas well as government function, the remaining land is owned by a smaller\npercentage of the people than ever before. The game of capitalism is almost\nwon. The game has only to be declared over and we will have to take matters\ninto our own hands and redistribute it again fairly, or else be enslaved in\nreturn for a place to live. Here in central California, already, fewer than\n30% own all the property and 5% of them own 90% of it. That's twice what it\nwas twenty years ago. Rents are so high that you pay 60% of your income for\nrent. If you just have a McJob, all you can afford is one room, if that.\nSome 30% of minimum wage workers are homeless. Unless you both have degrees\nin technical fields and are working in them, (in the midst of 30%\nunemployment in high tech jobs!), you will never own anything but a used\ncar if you choose to have more than one child!!! And everywhere else you\ncould afford there are no jobs. The only way to get there is to save and\nnot consume any more than you have to, clothing used, food poor. No movies,\nno entertainment,, ect. for about five to seven years, and then, if you've\nsaved $20,000, if you can get together that much, and that's ignoring your\nkids and working two jobs, then you can buy a home in Arkansas or Missouri\noutright and live somewhere where they flood every other year! That's an\nexaggeration if you pay close attention to the flood lines on other\npeople's houses and find a sturdy hill, then you can buy one up there! Also\nbuy a rowboat. Missouri's not so bad, if you like the sensation of sleeping\nin a sweatbox in summer and your car freezing solid in winter. They really\ndo put those heaters into the dipstick hole to keep them warm enough to\nstart with ether!:) Shit, kill the rich and redistribute the livable\nproperty. Kill all of them!\n-RSW\n\n>I want people to be able to work and gain a basic subsistance and more.\n>Is there a workable system for what you suggest?

Extra is kept for\nthe future. You get to stay where you are without paying rent. Land that\nsupports others becomes property of the state. Farmers are welcome to plant\ncrops that people need according to demand and ability and soil quality. If\nyou want to grow sourgum because you always did, and you aren't doing a\ngood job, then we let another farmer grow sorghum, and you grow something\nelse. When people die the land they were entitled to use goes into the\npublic holdings. No one can sell land, but they can trade places with\nanybody. No one can lease land. The government will locally distribute the\nuse of the land not used for residences. Residences that are insufficient\nto the families living there can be traded to the public for a larger house\nand yard according to need and availability. The local land council who vow\nto live on their land till death to avoid profit ties will decide fairness\nsubject to review by the state and federal land councils. It will cost no\nmore than any fucking thing costs now with fucking assed rent going down a\ndeep dark hole to the owners! Anyone can submit a request for a larger\nhouse or land to start a business on, depending on a valid business plan\nand community needs. Heavy equipment is subject to seizure for the public\ngood or as needed. Heavy equipment operators are encouraged to keep and\nmaintain their own machine and to operate it at a reasonable salary in\nservice to the community. Companies who own many machines are to be divided\namong the appropriate equipment operators and the rest to be let to valid\noperators on a need basis. Cost of upkeep is charged. A guild of heavy\nmachine operators is recognized for safety and training's sake. Their\ncouncil is a subcouncil to the community council. Etc. Etc. Etc. It isn't\nso hard to think of a better system than we have. All you have to do is\nrealize that the system we have now is not sacrosanct, in fact it's a\nrigged game that steals you blind and is the most unfair any system could\nbe already!!!!!!!! The trick is to realize that the old rich have been\nmaking the rules behind your back and that it's time to kick them off the\nmerry-go-round. Tax the rich to death. They are the ones that converted\nyour 60's school lunch program into the joke it is today. They are the ones\nwho always cut education. They are the ones who always raise the rent when\nyou get a raise. They are the ones who should be not just dislodged but\nkilled for their abuse. I have trouble justifying the death penalty for a\npoor kid who killed and didn't know why not. I have no trouble justifying\nthe death penalty for the rich who steal countless human lives to feed\ntheir greed! Have you paid rent most of your life? Then you have been\nenslaved, percentage wise, most of your life. We used to be serfs. Now we\nare called renters, and we are still enslaved to somebody who claims to own\nland they don't use and make us pay them for it when they did nothing to\nown it. Most rents in California are enough to buy the apartment house,\npaynthe taxes and the insurance and have a little left over to travel with!\nI have seen the books! I know what my landlord pays and to whom! I know\nwhat I pay her. I am being forced to buy her a building and then I will be\nlet out at the other end with nothing, when I had as much right as her to\nlive on this planet! And her child will have the money to likewise\nenslave my child. I hope I find out when I am going to die. I can make\nthings just a little happier form me to be able to destroy her life as she\ndestroyed mine. And maybe I can take a few other landlords with me, and\ntheir heirs. That would be worth it. Then to be able to die before they can\ndo anything to me. That's a poor man's dream. Sleep tight, bastard\nlandlords.

But that only for insurance ... and you\ncan't force a private insurance company to sell you a plan that they\nwill not offer.  And remember that the actual health care is delivered\nby private entities who collect from the public insurance voluntarily.\nAgain, they can't force a private entity to spring to life to pay them.\n\nPlus, there is the matter of culture and values ... I'm basically\nanti-tax and anti-government, by Canadian standards ... yet I can't\nbring myself to make the same arguments as you do, despite that I\nunderstand where you're coming from.  Up north, you're so much more\nlikely to find someone protesting taxes going to defence than health\ninsurance premiums to only one fund for basic coverage ...\n\n>>>(Interesting side note-have any new insurance companies started\n>>>up-from scratch-since Medicare became standard in Canada?\n>> \n>>I actually have doubts that any new ones have emerged since WW I ...\n>>no, scratch that ... there are a few in Western Canada, and *quite* \n>>a few in Quebec as part of the post-1980 Quebec Miracle (out with the\n>>nationalism, in with the French capitalism).

And if you do get\nthe training, the doctors monopoly might block your getting of a\nlicence because there is already someone in the business and who\ncannot fill his/her appointment book.

We just do\nnot have enough sick Canadians in absolute numbers otherwise.\n\n>I personally think an approach like Germany's would be best-where the\n>companies compete for batches of people.

The competition is fake if it exists at all, because they're\nall interlinked.  Look in Der Spiegel or Stern (my girlfriend is in\nour German department  and her uncle is a private practicioner in\nSaarbrucken) ... no ads for health insurance.  While Canada organizes\nby province, Germany organizes the paperwork around big corporations\nand regional offices.   But remember that we have provinces that have\nthe same population as some major German corporations.  Germans have\npublic health insurance, just that it is brokered by smaller entities\n(actually, brokerage of basic by private firms who'll sell extra\ninsurance to fill out their policies, sort of a voucher system,\nwas one of the first ideas floated in Canada, too).\n\nRemember, the Germans don't have HMO's ... a telling sign, 'cos\nRochester does and they're also a company town.\n\n>But there was a Washington Post article recently about that that said\n>Canadian doctors often use myelograms instead of MRIs, which require\n>spinal injections and can cause seizures and headaches.

If much or some of it were true, you'd have to take\nus for idiots for tolerating it.

They do not try to decide just\nwhether pro-nazi, pro-choice, pro-life, or pro-tax political speech\nshould be allowed on the sidewalk in front of the post office.  You can\nimagine the result if right to free speech was decided by the majority\non a case-by-case basis.\n\nNot so with economic issues.  Government does tell taxi-drivers exactly\nwhat they can charge, but not the bus lines or the lawyers.\n\nJust as it is not desireable to decide rights of free speech on a\ncase-by-case basis, we should not decide rights to free enterprise on a\ncase-by-case basis.\n\nThere is hope that a government can be restricted from interferring with\nfree enterprise.  But there is no hope, in my opinion, of having a\ngovernment that interferes with free enterprise in an \"efficient\"\nmanner; I call it political market failure.\n\nThus, if you value freedom and the abundance it produces, you have to\nswallow the \"whole libertarian agenda.\"\n\nRoger Collins\n"

In actuality it is \"chorion\", which is the last word Acts\n> 1:18.  Unfortunately my Greek dictionary does not discuss \"chorion\" so I\n> cannot report as to the nuances of the word.\n\nI abhor publishing trash (I abhor it of myself even more than I do from\nothers, but since I do not present myself as an authority on the subject, I do\nnot feel dishonest, though I do openly admit ignorance and incompetence in\nthis example).  Thus I felt honor bound to do a better set of research\nspecifically on the word.  First it should be noted that Greek grammar is not\nas tough as I first assumed (it is not nontrivial by any means, and I still am\nnot competent with it, but it is not as opaque as I had thought).  It turns\nout that while the Index for the Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich \"Greek Lexicon\" renders\neach verse in order, each word within a verse is put in greek alphabetical\norder.  Thus while the the meaning of the verse is decipherable, the syntax is\nfar from clear.  On the other hand, a Greek-English Intralinear Bible makes\nthings a lot more comprehendable.  And yes, the word for field in Acts 1:18 is\nindeed \"chorion.\" \n\nNow I've checked several Greek-English lexicons:\n\n\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Louw and Nida\n\t\"Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament\"\n\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Grimm\n\t\"Word study Concordance,\" Tynsdale\n\t\"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other \n\t early Christian Writings,\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich\n\t\"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\" Perschbacher\n\nIn each case the meaning of the word Chorion was given variously as:\n\n\tA space, place, region, district, field, area, \"country place,\" \n\tland, farm, estate, \"a bit of tillage\", and similar meanings.\n\nNowhere do any of these books mention anything about \"grave.\" As some of these \nbooks go into great detail, I would be very surprised to find that these books \nare all inadequate and Mr Archer is the only competent scholar in Greek.  I \nthink it more likely that Mr Archer's investigations into \"contradictions\" to \nbe once again, as your friend said it, \"lacking in substance,\" and thus Archer \nis again shown worthless as an expert witness (By the way Mr DeCenso, I would \nhave honorably presented my results on this matter, even if I had found them\nto support Mr Archer's contentions). \n\nBy the way, among these lexicons, (eg: Robinson's) is the definition of\n\"agros,\" the word used in Matthew 27 to describe the field bought.  The word\n\"agros\" is defined as \"a field in the country.\" Chorion is specifically noted\nas a synonym to agros.  This is significant, as it is evidence of how silly\nBullinger's exegisis was, which stated that the word for \"field\" in Matthew\n(ie: agros) is different from the word for \"field\" in Acts (ie: chorion), and\nthus we must be talking about two different fields (Of course you already\nadmit how stupid Bullinger's exegisis is, but this was a small serendipity\nwhich drives the point home). \n\nSo as of now, unless Mr DeCenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise\n(eg: a reputable scholar with reputable references), I consider this \nparticular issue closed.  See Mr DeCenso, now you can go on to answer\nquestions about the denials of Peter, the day of the Crucifixion, Tyre, and \nthe fact that the author of Matthew quoted from the wrong prophet in\ndiscussing the \"Potter's Field.\"\n \n\t\t\t\tLater,\n\n\t\t\t\tDave Butler\n\n    Precise knowledge is the only true knowledge, and he who does not teach\n    exactly, does not teach at all.\n\t\t\t\tHenry Ward Beecher\n\t\t\t\tAmerican Clergyman\n\t\t\t\tas recorded by George Seldes\n"

None of this sounds like a \"small\nfishing village\" by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nCenturies later, under the Abbasids, Tyre had \"opulent and flourishing\nbazaars\" and buildings of 5-6 stories.  During this period, Tyre was\n\"noted for its export of sugar, beads, and, as of old, glassware.\"\nDuring the Crusades, Tyre was the second-most flourishing city held\nby Franks.  (There is a lot more, but I got tired of writing.)\n\nIn [2] we read the following description of modern Lebanon: \"other\n*major cities* in Lebanon include Tripoli, Sidon, Tyre, Baalbek and\nZahlah.\"  [my emphasis]  This source also discusses the impact of\nthe Lebanese Civil War, and the Israeli military actions (1978, 1982)\non the trading ports of Tyre and Sidon.  It notes that after Israel's\nwithdrawel in 1984, \"Tyre appeared to enjoy a revival of its local\neconomy.\"\n\nIf Tyre is such an insignificant little fishing village at present,\nwhy is it always called a city (or, above, a \"major city\")?

They\nmay even use cars these days. :-) \n\nThe 1991 Encyclopedia Britannica says \"Pop. (1982 est.) 23,000.\"  \nMost other references give figures in the 14-17 thousand range.\n(One atlas gives the population of Tyre as 60,000; the same\nsource give comparatively high figures for Sidon and Beirut, also,\nso I doubt that it is a typo.  Perhaps these were figures for\nthe cities and their surrounding areas.)  I don't doubt that the\npopulation of Tyre has fluctuated over the last few decades.  In\nparticular, the 1982 Israeli military action hurt Tyre quite a bit.   \n\n>> After Alex the G it fell once more in the 1200's, I believe.

An awful lot of the\nstarvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economic\npolicies of the Western countries, as well as by the diet of the typical\nWesterner.  For instance, some third-world countries with terrible\nmalnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce -- so that it can\nbe fed to cattle in the US, to make tender juicy steaks and burgers.  They\nhave to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loans\nwe encouraged them to take out.  Fund-raising for Ethiopia is a truly bizarre\nidea; instead, we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny they've got.\n\nPerhaps it's more accurate to say that there's a Western ethic against\nWestern infanticide.  All the evidence suggests that so long as the children\nare dying in the Third World, we couldn't give a shit.  And that goes for the\nsupposed \"Pro-Life\" movement, too.  They could save far more lives by\nfighting against Third World debt than they will by fighting against\nabortion.  Hell, if they're only interested in fetuses, they could save more\nof those by fighting for human rights in China.\n\nAnd besides, Suzanne's answer implies that non-Western countries lack this\nethic against infanticide.  Apart from China, with its policy of mandatory\nforced abortion in Tibet, I don't believe this to be the case.\n\n\nmathew\n"

Hold it! You have a few problems here. Official history says that \nthe first accusations of homosexuality in the SA came from OUTSIDE of the Nazi \nparty, long BEFORE the Nazis ever came to power. So this objection is a red\nherring, even if established history is wrong on this point. Moreover, none of \nthe histories I've read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using \nhomosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm. A point I saw reiterated was that\nHitler and the party covered up these accusations. If you are going to accuse\nofficial history of being a fabrication, you should at least get your facts\nright. The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA in\na coup against Hitler. Nowhere is there mention of using allegations of\nhomosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (it\nis possible that the histories I've read have not mentioned this, but I doubt\nit - would it be in Hitler's best interest to admit to the world that his\nformer right hand man was a homosexual?). \n\nAnyway, as I said before, it is always possible that I have missed references \nto the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the \nnight of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false. Even \nthe Nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage. In any case, \nthis does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the \n1920's.\n\n>Since the accusers thereafter controlled the records,\n>anything bearing on the subject -- true or not -- has to be considered\n>tainted evidence. \n\nAh, yes. I forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy. I can smell the\nparanoia from here. Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with \nhomosexuality (at least, not according to what I've read), I'd like to know \nwhat tainted \"evidence\" you are talking about. Since the accusations were made \nby persons outside of the Nazi party, long before it came to power, and those \naccusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the \n1920's and 30's, just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in \ntime and plant \"tainted\" evidence? How exactly does one doctor newspapers \nwhich were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being \nobvious? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matter\ndo you know about? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in \nthese matters, some of whom were not Nazis? And what is the point of making a \nfalse accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? Since the point \nhere seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof \nfalls on the revisionist. The revisionists had better do their homework \nbefore making accusations. Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts.\n\n>The available data suggest that Roehm and his crowd,\n>the SA -- Sturmabteilung, \"Storm Troopers\" -- left the world a better\n>place when they departed, \n\nThis is just about the *only* thing we agree on. \n\nI suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and \nhis SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people. The feeling\nseems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality, that this\nmust be an attempt to bash homosexuals. This fear - often justified - is what\nlies behind this distrust of official history, or so it seems to me. But this\nis not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject. If \nyou really think that historians are so incompetent, why don't you write them \nand ask where they got their sources on this subject, if you can't tell from \ntheir footnotes? I'm a graduate student in history. Writing to professors and\ntracking down sources is old hat. But my time is limited and this is not my\nspecialty - and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would\ncast one shred of doubt on existing evidence. I'm not going to waste my time\ntrying to debunk someone's paranoia. Do the research yourself.\n\n>but concrete particulars are still no more than\n>more or less shrewd guesses.  \n>-- Diccon Frankborn\n\nGiven that you already consider all evidence \"tainted\", what on earth would\nconstitute concrete particulars? And since when have concrete particulars been\nconsidered \"shrewd guesses\"?\n\nI suggest that those who do not trust popular historians (Irving et al) -\nhistorians writing for a popular audience do not, as a rule, provide copious \nfootnotes - should try instead reading academic historians, who usually \nprovide footnotes to all their sources in immmense detail.

Robert Weiss writes [a promise from Psalm 9:10]\n>Gee, since you wouldn't be at all hypocritical, you must be really\n>busy arguing against these out-of-context extracted translations!\n\nHe directed a similar accusation of hypocrisy, again based on a lack of\nresponse to an article by Robert Weiss, toward Stephen.\n\nI pointed out that I did, in fact, agree that both Robert Weiss and\nJim Meritt took quotes out of context.  Hence, I find it difficult to\nunderstand why Jim thinks I am a hypocrite.  Needless to say, I don't\nhave time to reply to *every* article on t.r.m. that takes a quote\nout of context.  \n\nI asked Jim the following:\n>}So, according to you, Jim, the only way to criticize one person for\n>}taking a quote out of context, without being a hypocrite, is to post a\n>}response to *every* person on t.r.m who takes a quote out of context?\n\nJim replied by saying \n>Did I either ask or assert that?\n\nBut today we find four articles from Jim, one of which has the subject\n\"Silence is concurrence\":  \n\nm23364@mwunix.mitre.org (James Meritt) writes:\n>Is it not the case that, in the eyes of the law, when someone is aware of\n>something and has the capability of taking action and does not, that individual\n>may be held responsible for that action?\n\nWhich is, of course, a complete red herring.  Taking quotes out of\ncontext isn't a crime.  I don't have time to read every article on\nt.r.m., and I'm certainly under no obligation to reply to them all.\n\nDoes \"silence is concurrence\" imply that Jim thinks that because I\ndidn't respond to Weiss' articles I must condone Weiss' taking quotes\nout of context?  Jim doesn't want to give a direct answer to this\nquestion; read what he has written and decide for yourself.\n\n\nBut back to the context of my conversation with Jim.  Jim's next \ngambit was to claim that he was using inductive logic when he\nconcluded that I was being a hypocrite.  I challenged him to provide\nthe details of that logic that led him to an incorrect conclusion.\nToday we find another obscure article (posting it twice didn't help\nmake it more clear, Jim), titled \"Inductive Logic\":\n\n>Scenario:\n>A white goose waddles past the door\n>A white goose waddles past the door\n>A white goose waddles past the door\n>...( repeat an uncountably large number of times)...\n>A black goose waddles past the door.

If ONLY black geese are observed to be axed, is it not a valid question \n>   to be concerned with the different behavior between black and white geese?\n\nMore red herrings.  Could Jim mean that he has read an uncountably large\nnumber of my articles?  Could Jim mean that because I \"axed\" his articles,\nbut not Weiss' articles, he wants to conclude inductively ...\nWell, I can't see where he is going with this.\n\nBut I can help him with his induction.  I've written roughly 80\narticles since January.  The vast majority of them are discussions with\nFrank DeCenso and other inerrantists, where I take the position that\nthey are making bad arguments.  Some are discussions with Jim Meritt\nwhere I take the position that he is making bad arguments (a straw man\nargument earlier, and taking quotes out of context more recently.)\n\nThink hard about this Jim.

Gentiles could be part of the kingdom of\nHeaven through the saving grace of God.  I never said that the Law was made\nobsolete by Jesus.\n\nIf anything, He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made.  In the\nfollowing verses, Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon\nthe Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended.  If you'll notice, He\nalso reams into the Pharisees for mucking up the Law with their own contrived\ninterpretations.  They knew every letter of the Law and followed it with their\nheads but not their hearts.  That is why He points out that our righteousness\nmust surpass that of the Pharisees in order to be accepted into the kingdom\nof Heaven.  People such as the Pharisees are those who really go out of their\nway to debate about the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin.\nThey had become legalistic, rule-makers - religious lawyers who practiced the\nletter of the Law but never really believed in it.  \n\nI think you will agree with me that there are in today's world, a lot of\nmodern-day Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe\nin it.  What good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart?\n\nChristianity is not just a set of rules; it's a lifestyle that changes one's\nperspectives and personal conduct.  And it demands obedience to God's will.\nSome people can live by it, but many others cannot or will not.  That is their\nchoice and I have to respect it because God respects it too.\n\nGod be with you,\n\nMalcolm Lee  :)\n"

Each year the Team\nputs on hundreds of athletic events, including several world-class\nultramarathons, marathons and triathlons, in dozens of countries.\n\nThe Peace Run itself is inspired by the global peace ambassador\nSri Chinmoy, who has written and lectured extensively on peace,\noffered hundreds of free peace concerts and met with countless\nworld figures to advance the cause of international harmony.\n\nThe Run is managed by Peace Runs International, a non-profit\norganization based in the United States.\n\n\n               ----  Take a Step For Peace  ----\n\nThe Peace Runs in 1987, 1989 and 1991 attracted nearly half a\nmillion participants.

From the time he is born, the\n     theist is brought up with the notion of the\n     \"truth\" of some kind of scripture-- the Bible,\n     the Torah, the Qur'an, & etc.  He is told\n     of this wondrous God who wrote (or inspired)\n     the scripture, of the prophets talked about in\n     the scripture, of the miracles performed, & etc.\n     He is also told that to question this (as\n     children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime\n     against God, and to lose belief in the scrip-\n     ture's truth is to damn one's soul to Hell.\n     Thus, by the time he is able to read the\n     scripture for himself, the belief in its \"truth\"\n     is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a\n     matter of course.\n     \nBut it doesn't stop there.  Once the child is able\n     to read for himself, there is an endeavor to\n     inculcate the child the \"right\" readings of\n     scripture, to concentrate more on the pleasant\n     readings, to gloss over the worse ones, and to\n     explain away the unexplainable with \"mystery.\"\n     Circular arguments, \"self-evdent\" facts and\n     \"truths,\" unreasoning belief, and fear of\n     hell is the meat of religion the child must eat\n     of every day.  To doubt, of course, means wrath\n     of some sort, and the child must learn to put\n     away his brain when the matter concerns God.\n     All of this has some considerable effect on the\n     child, so that when he becomes an adult, the \n     superstitions he's been taught are nearly\n     impossible to remove.\n     \nAll of this leads me to ask whether the theist can\n     truly be objective when questioning God, Hell,\n     Heaven, the angels, souls, and all of the rest.\n     Can he, for a moment, put aside this notion that\n     God *does* exist and look at everything from\n     a unbiased point of view?  Obviously, most\n     theists can somewhat, especially when presented\n     with \"mythical gods\" (Homeric, Roman, Egyptian,\n     & etc.).  But can they put aside the assumption\n     of God's existence and question it impartially?\n     \nStephen\n\n    _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/_/   _/       _/    * Atheist\n   _/        _/    _/   _/ _/ _/ _/     * Libertarian\n  _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/_/   _/   _/  _/      * Pro-individuality\n       _/  _/     _/  _/       _/       * Pro-responsibility\n_/_/_/_/  _/      _/ _/       _/ Jr.    * and all that jazz...\n\n\n\n-- \n"

The original letters he wrote have\n>>long since decayed into dust.

Somehow I doubt do that yourself\nthat.  Thus since I doubt you accept everything written in every historical\ndocument, I would ask how you can thereby objectively justify complete faith\nin the words of the books attributed to Peter. \n\nI shall now give an example of a document from antiquity, which I am sure you\nreject; it dates from the time of Ramses II (This was first presented here by\nMatthew Wiener).  These inscriptions were carved soon after a battle, and were\ncarved with the Pharoah's specific approval so we have true originals, rather\nthan mere copies.  This account records the the battle of Kadesh (circa 1285\nBC), which occurred on the river Orontes, (about 100 miles south of Aleppo). \nThe Egyptians won this battle with the Hittites, and Ramses had his victory\ninscribed all over the place.  A few of of these inscriptions have survived in\nnear perfect form.  It is a record of how the Pharoah pretty much\nsingle-handedly defeated the Hittites, after being separated from his troops. \n\nNote that the Egyptian wavers back and forth between first and third person. \nThe following is from Miriam Lichtheim`s _Ancient Egyptian Literature_ volume\nII.\n\n\tMy majesty caused the forces of the foes from Hitti to fall\n\ton their faces, one upon the other, as crocodiles fall, into\n\tthe water of the Orontes.  I was after them like a griffin;\n\tI attacked all the countries, I alone.  For my infantry and\n\tmy chariotry had deserted me; not one of them stood looking\n\tback.  As I live, as Ra loves me, as my father Atum favors\n\tme, everything that my majesty has told I did it in truth,\n\tin the presence of my infantry and my chariotry.\n\n(Note: This paragraph records not only Ramses \"divine word,\" but also that\nthere were thousands of witnesses to the event.  Now from the heart of \nbattle.)\n\n\tThen his majesty drove at a gallop and charged the forces\n\tof the Foe from Hitti, being alone by himself, none other\n\twith him.  His majesty proceeded to look about him and\n\tfound 2500 chariots ringing him on his way out ...\n\n\tNo officer was with me, no charioteer,\n\tNo soldier of the army, no shield-bearer;\n\tMy infantry, my chariotry yielded before them,\n\tNot one of them stood firm to fight with them.\n\tHis majesty spoke: \"What is this, father Amun?\n\tIs it right for a father to ignore his son?\n\tAre my deeds a matter for you to ignore?\n\tDo I not walk and stand at your word?\n\tI have not neglected an order you gave.\n\tToo great is he, the great lord of Egypt,\n\tTo allow aliens to step on his path!\n\tWhat are these Asiatics to you, O Amun,\n\tThe wretches ignorant of god?\n\tHave I not made for you many great monuments,\n\t...\n\tI call to you, my father Amun,\n\tI am among a host of strangers;\n\tAll countries are arrayed against me,\n\tI am alone, there's none with me!\n\t...\n\tThe labors of many people are nothing,\n\tAmun is more helpful than they;\n\tI came here by the command of your mouth,\n\tO Amun, I have not transgressed your command!\"\n\n\tNow though I prayed in a distant land,\n\tMy voice resounded in Southern Thebes.\n\tI found Amun came when I called to him,\n\tHe gave me his hand and I rejoiced.\n\tHe called from behind as if near by:\n\t\"Forward, I am with you,\n\tI your father, my hand is with you,\n\tI prevail over a hundred thousand men,\n\tI am lord of victory, lover of valor!\"\n\tI found my heart stout, my breast in joy,\n\tAll I did succeeded, I was like Mont.\n\t...\n\tI slaughtered among them at my will,\n\tNot one looked behind him,\n\tNot one turned around,\n\tWhoever fell down did not rise.\n\t...\n\tOne called out to the other saying:\n\t\"No man is he who is among us,\n\tIt is Seth great-of-strength, Baal in person;\n\tNot deeds of man are these his doings,\n\tThey are of one who is unique,\n\tWho fights a hundred thousand without soldiers and chariots,\n\tCome quick, flee before him,\n\tTo seek life and breathe air;\n\tFor he who attempts to get close to him,\n\tHis hands, all his limbs grow limp.\n\tOne cannot hold either bow or spears,\n\tWhen one sees him come racing along!\"\n\tMy majesty hunted them like a griffin,\n\tI slaughtered among them unceasingly.\n\nSo you see Brian, we have a few original manuscripts recording the miraculous \nbattle between the Ramses and the Hittites.  Do you reject them as being\n*completely* true? I suspect you do, and if so, then do you also, in your own\nwords: \n\n    \"question the existence of Alexander the Great, Tilgrath Pilisar III,\n     Nero, Caligula, Josephus, Cyrus the Great, Artexerxes?\"\n\nDo you also thereby question all their documents? That`s the problem with your\n\"all or nothing\" approach.  Many ancient people used to mix a bit of fancy\nwith their facts.  So for you to say that we must either accept all of Peter\n(and the rest of the New Testament) or accept no records of antiquity at all,\nforces you thereby, to accept the verity of documents you probably do not find\ncompletely credible. \n\nAs to your other argument that so many people have testified to Jesus, that he\nmust be true:\n\n> Are you going to just pass off all this testimony as fictiousness? \n> Are you going to call three thousand years worth of testimony from\n> shepherds to IRS agents to royal officials to kings to computer\n> programmers, fiction?  With a scoff of your keyboard, with near\n> complete ignorance of the testimonies, are you going to say that\n> that is all complete hooey?   Would that not be the most audacious\n> display of arrogance?  Do you actually think you know better than\n> King Solomon, King David, or even Abraham Lincoln?\n \nI have three points.  \n\nFirst, this is \"argumentum ad populum\" (ie: appeal to popular opinion); you\ncannot vote on truth.  For instance, do the millions of Hindu's past and\npresent who testify to the reality of Brahma, constitute actual evidence for\nthe existence of Brahma? How would you answer your own question in regards to\nthe testimony of Hindus:\n\n\t\"With a scoff of your keyboard, with near complete ignorance of \n\t the testimonies, are you going to say that that is all complete \n\t hooey?\"\n\nIf you do so \"scoff,\" then how do you objectively justify your own special\npleading?\n\nSecond, it is not at all clear that King Solomon or King David testified to\nJesus.  You can claim it to be clear, but that does not make it true. \n\nThird, it is quite arguable that Abraham Lincoln was not Christian, and that\nhe had both a public and a private view of Christianity.  In fact there was\nmuch discussion about it in his day (yes, he was publically accused of being a\ndeist.  Oh my).  I am presently collecting a FAQ for Lincoln as I've\npreviously done for Tyre, Jefferson and etc. \n \n\t\t\t\tLater,\n\n\t\t\t\tDave Butler\n\n    \"My earlier views of the unsoundness of the Christian scheme of \n     salvation and the human origin of the scriptures, have become \n     clearer and stronger with advancing years and I see no reason for \n     thinking I shall ever change them.\"\n\t\t\t\t\tAbraham Lincoln\n\t\t\t\t\tTo Judge J S Wakefield \n\t\t\t\t\tafter the death of Willie Lincoln.\n"

                    "content": "From: neese@cerritos.edu\nSubject: Hell\n\n    In the King James Version of the Bible there are three differents words \ntranslated into the word \"hell\".  These Greek words have totally different \nmeanings.  The words are Hades, Tartaros, and Gehenna.\n\n    In bibical usage, the Greek word Hades is used only 11 times in the \nNew Testament, and is roughly the equivalent to the Old Testament word Sheol...\nmeaning the grave or pit (compare Acts 2:27 with Psalms 16:10).  Hades may be \nlikened to a hole in the ground. (In the Bible it has nothing to do with fire!)\n\n    Most modern bibical translators admit that the use in the English word hell\nto translate Hades and Sheol are an unfortunate and misleading practice.  \n\n    Why?  Because when seeing the word \"hell\" many readers impute to it the \ntraditional connotation of an ever-burning inferno, when this was never \nremotely intended in the Greek language or in Old English!\n\n    In its true bibical usage Hades does indeed refer to the state or abode of \nthe dead, but not in the sense of spirits walking around in some sort of \n\"shadowy realm.\"  Hades is simply the abode we call the grave.  All dead go to \nthis hell.\n\n    The second \"hell\" of the Bible, Tartaros, is mentioned only once in \nscripture, 2 Pet.2:4; \"For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast \nthem down to hell (TARTAROS), and delivered them into chains of darkness to be \nreserved unto judgment...\"\n\n    Following their rebellion to unseat God from His throne (Isa.14:12-14; \nRev.12:4), the archangel Lucifer (now Satan) and a third of the created angels \n(now demons) were ejected from heaven (Luke 10:18).  They were cast down to \nTartaros, a place or condition of restraint that God has imposed on the \nmutinous angels as they await ultimate judgment (Jude 6; 1 Cor.6:3).\n\n    Tartaros, then, is a \"hell\" that applies only to evil, rebellious angels or\ndemons (It is interesting that the ancient Greeks used this word to describe \nthe place in which Zeus confined the rebellious Titans).  Nowhere in the Bible \nis there any mention of men being put into this particular \"hell\".\n\n    The the third word that is translated as \"hell\" in the Bible is Gehenna. It\ncomes from the Hebrew GAI HINNOM, meaning \"valley of Hinniom.\"  Hinnom is a \ndeep, narrow ravine located to the south and southwest of Jerusalem.\n\n    In Old Testament times it was a place of abominable pagan rites, including \ninfant sacrifice (It was there that the apostate kings Ahaz and Manasseh made \ntheir children \"pass through the fire\" to the god Molech.  The rites were \nspecifically celebrated in Tophet, the \"place of abhorrence,\" one of the chief \ngroves in the valley).\n\n    King Josiah of ancient Judah finally put an end to these abominations.  He \ndefiled the valley, rendering it ceremonially unclean (2 Kings 23:10).  Later \nthe valley became the cesspool and city dump of Jerusalem; a repository for \nsewage, refuse and animal carcasses.  The bodies of dispised criminals were \nalso burned there along with the rubbish.  Fires burned continuously, feeding \nby a constant supply of garbage and refuse.\n\n    Aceldama, the \"field of blood\", purchased with the money Judas received for\nthe betrayal of Christ (Matt.27:8) was also in part of the valley of Hinnom.\n\n    So what does this valley called Gehenna have to do with hell?  \n\n    In Rev.19:20: the Satan inspired political dictator and a miracle-working \nreligious figure, the False Prophet, working with him will resist the \nre-establishment of the government of God by Jesus Christ at His Second Coming.\nTheir fate is revealed by the apostle John: \"And the beast was taken, and with \nhim the false prophet...  These both were cast alive into a lake of fire \nburning with brimstone.\"\n    \n    Where will this temporary lake of fire (this \"hell\") be?\n\n    The prophet Isaiah wrote of this lake of fire prepared for the Beast: \"For \nTophet (in the valley of Hinnom) is ordained of old, yea for the king it is \nprepared, he hath made it deep and large, the pile thereof is fire and wood, \nthe breath of the Lord, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it\" (Isa.30:33).\n\n    One thousand years later, Satan himself will be cast into this rekindled \nfiery lake where the Beast and False Prophet were cast! (Rev.20:10).\n\n    But what of the wicked who have died over the millennia?  Does the Bible \nsay that they are now suffering fiery punishment for their sins in a lake of \nfire?\n\n    In the sequence of Rev.20 the incorrigibly wicked are resurrected to be \nthrown into the lake of fire after Satan is cast there! (Rev.20:15). What will \nbecome of these wicked?  Will they writhe in flames for eternity? \n \n    The wicked will be burned up from the intense heat of the coming Gehenna \nfire on the earth.  They wil be consumed, annihilated, destroyed!  This \npunishment will be everlasting (permanent and final).  The Bible calls it the \n\"second death\" (Rev.20:14; 21:8), from which there is no possibility of a \nfurther resurrection.\n\n    The Bible does teach eternal punishment, but not eternal punishing.\n                           \n    The prophet Malachi provides a graphic description. \"For, behold, the day \ncometh that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do \nwickedly, shall be stubble, and the day that cometh shall burn them up...\"\n(4:1).  To the righteous, God says that the wicked shall be \"ashes under the \nsoles of your feet...\"(Mal.4:3).\n\n    Gehenna was a place of destruction and death, not a place of living \ntorture!  Jesus was talking to Jews who understood all about this Gehenna or \nvalley of Hinnom.  Utter destruction by fire was complete.  Nothing was left, \nbut ashes!\n \n    Every text in the Bible translated from this Greek word Gehenna means \ncomplete destruction, not living torture (not eternal life in torment)!  The \nBible says, in Romans 6:23, \"The wages of sin is death\", not eternal life in \ntorture.  The punishment revealed in the Bible is Death... the cessation of \nlife. \n    \n    Eternal life is the GIFT OF GOD!\n"
